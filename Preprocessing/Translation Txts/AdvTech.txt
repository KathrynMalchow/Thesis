"Makes very accurate crop circles. Just uploaded your favourite picture then sit back and relax while the tractor cuts it in great detail into your crop."

"There is a bug that won't let you change implement width using imperial 
units. You have to set first and then switch to metric to make it change. 
The UI could use improvement. The tracking was awful but that's maybe more 
the phones fault"
"Has promise but is severely lacking in instructions for use to get the best out of it... especially for saving fields and coverage logging to come back to the next day. A dozen YouTube videos on the obvious functions aren't enough and useless if you need to check how to do some function you find you need out on the job if you don't have internet in the field. Synchronizing data is no good without internet (very patchy where I am) so if you close the app or it crashes then you lose your data. This happens repeatedly and is very frustrating. More instructions please or else I will have to keep looking at competitors."
"App loads the first time then won't load after that"
"AgriBus-Connect, Can't activate by email, can't sign up, is there is having any support forum or help instruction?  Fast respond, And after few hours software updated and problem solved!!!"
"Junk Does not work, it's  junk"
"Very good"
"Good app Good app but more instructions are needed i.e what perameters need changing to get G-Mouse exturnal GPS antenna to work. Area is not accurate. I find when app says 0.66ha actual area covered is 1ha .thanks for the great app but hope to see more detailed instructions in future please."
"US version Can't see where to change to English units!  MPH, feet, acres.   Also, no way to save data."
"Great app Would be great to be able to save data and A/B lines etc and to be able to share with other staff. Can the paid version do this?"
"V useful Great simple app to use when try to fertilise fields and spray without a exspesive guidance system"
"Can't get it to function I'm from UK and can't get this to function on my phone (lg g3) with Android 5.0 or on my tablet nexus7. Is there a GPS antenna that's recommended and a micro usb adapter cable that can be got ect that might fix this problem."
"Works great for broadcast planting and spraying Look forward to future development. Would love to see basic field mapping feature added to this app."
"Needs imperial units: acres, feet, mph Very promising, but lacks anything other than the metric system.  Fix this, and it will explode in popularity."
"Is there a users manual to help setting it up ?"
"AgriBus.Nav I couldn't believe how well this works and how much i use it in the tractor . Highly recommended."
"Will not open on Galaxy Note 10.1 4.4.2.  Thanks! It does work on my phone. Galaxy Note 4 version 4.4.4.  Very good app."
"Great"
"If it would allow me to use ft and inches and not metric I would use it."
"Otlichno raboti."
"Okk"

"I love it"
"Has potential, but anything I submit it returns no results. It says there is not enough information. Tomatoes aren't even on the list it offered. I give it 3 stars for the potential. At the moment it is useless to me. I'm just baffled that it doesn't know some of the basic garden plants. Or rather \"not enough information\". Even though it only asked for a photo, and what general species the plant is."
"Great app thats useful for growers to identify plant issues. Responses from the experts are fast and helpful. One suggestion is for the problem questionnaire to include more crop types to select inside or to let the user manually key in the plant species itself, as not every plant type is listed. Would totally recommend this app."
"Looks good. Excellent UI simple and easy to use. Graphics are appealing. Felt like as if the rating perhap don't reflect the amount of efforts put into making it work."
"Good. Responsive team."
"I have been using this for more than a month. I am on the Premier package. The team at Agrio are outstanding <U+0001F44F>. They have responded to each and every enquiry I send. They communicate very well seeking clarification if necessary and Sometimes photos to enable them to analyse the problem. The advice I have received is excellent. I normally do some research myself and have found their advice spot on. I am extremely pleased with Agrio and the team. I have recommend Agrio to friends and family"
"All I want is an app where I upload the photo, type in the plant and get the disease. I don't want to be hit with a sales pitch before I even open the app for an upgrade. I needed to identify a tree. couldn't find trees. Had to install."
"really its a great app. but few experts need to add in agrio team . speacially cotton pathalogist and entomologist. and kindly add weed expert . video should be downloaded when we had problem.only pics are not sufficient to diagnose problem .thanks .luni"
"Brilliant app! I appreciate the expertise of the team, they devote allot of time to get to the bottom of things and help as much as they can. It is very much appreciated!"
"The community in this app is really great. I usually get answers to my questions within the day and diagnosis has been pretty accurate in my experience."
"Very quick answer. Even if the app didn't recognise the issue, the community of people have responded."
"So far so good , I manage a nursery and sometimes need to research thing I've not seen before . I did that and got answers I was looking for."
"Please make user friendly interface, included some important features and also update database of plants disease section."
"Started charging a monthly fee without my knowledge. Even tho I had uninstalled this app immediately, it still charged my google play acct <U+0001F92C><U+0001F92C>"
"the photo recognition of diseases still seems Limited but the expert response is quick and very helpful"
"Good application If you tell them a problem, they will not listen to it for 48 hours. When the plants are completely damaged, their suggestion comes."
"Worst app no help yet, I have send many damage on crop but no discuss or help from agrio team. Really such a worst app"
"I felt,this app must be useful in agronomy,but I have downloaded just 9 hours ago."
"Excellent application with usually a quick response..."
"The idenification of damage | deficiency is good but, there is need to improve/update in recommendations."
"I CANT CANCEL MY SUBSRIBTION I ALMOST LOST MY MONEY IN THIS APP TERRIBLE APP NO CANCEL OPTION. You dont have option for Cancelation its a scam"

"Best farming app"
"Best farming app"
"Very helpful app"
"Much needed app. Found it very useful. Great initiative.. All the best guys. Keep Growing."
"Great app, simple to use and clutter free interface. Are there any plans for curve guidance based on the last pass? Not all fields have straight edges here! Would also be good if you didn't have to create the field first, as when working as a contractor, you may go to fields you haven't been to before and not have time to set it up."
"Very frustrating. First of all, the highlight of the implement width does not show anywhere when you open the saved track. Only the line followed by the tractor on top of the other lines for the background map. Second when you try to select a track and share it as KML nothing happens. the share button for the tracks does not work. I can only share the full map but not the tracks that are the most imports thing for me for my spraying records. With this two issues the app is useless for me."
"This app has proved very useful for spray and fertilizer applications for me. My work is involved with GPS mapping in the utility industry and I've worked with numerous GIS softwares. This app is good and I would love to see an option to add problem points to save in the field maps and/or the saved tracks to note rocks or sink holes for hay cutting. This would make it a 5 star rating! I've loaded the app for two of my hay buddies so far. Thank you!"
"Good little app. Still using the free version as it does most of what I require. Allow curves and I will be paying for the Premium version... Clear and easy to read in use on a tractor and quite intuitive... which is rare. <U+0001F609> I use a Garmin Glo for a better level of accuracy, as the phone or tablet GPS only is not really accurate enough for fertiliser spreading. The app is not suitable without Egnos or RTK for spraying purposes. Would love to see a basic GIS mapping option and Records."
"Excellent app. Still learning more as I go has lots of good features. Has good accuracy with phone gps in a Motorola but will buy an external gps soon to improve accuracy a little. Works amazing spraying a spreading pasture and hay fields always within the 1 feet as I use for my overlap. If you have had your phones gps turned off turn it on for a few minutes before begining to get a good results."
"Great potential but not there yet. Fields are created before navigating. Thats ok. But when those fields are navigated another day, the GPS signal is offset and the program leaves no way to fix it. Needs to be a way to correct GPS signal by going to a known spot and then telling the program where you really are. Also, Lightbar is hard to use. Need to be able to change resolution and size of Lightbar. Could add a poor man's rtk by using another android at a known location to send a data stream."
"all right, after using it for a bit, I was wondering why it didn't match any of my measuring wheel calcs that i walked around the fields with. it understated surface area by over 15% in some fields, up to 30% in the steepest one I have. Reason is, It doesn't do a 3d calculation of surface area that includes elevations! So basically just a rough calculation of flat surface areas. Makes a huge diff when spraying/planting... Maybe incorporate in next update? Thanks"
"like it. has some nice features that I don't even have on my purchased navigation system that costs several thousand dollars, like being able to see the field on satellite image and being able to mark in field boundaries manually without driving around the field. thanks for building this product!"
"first time using GPS guidance glad I went with a free app instead of shelling out for a budget light bar setup, I assume it does the same thing, and at first wasn't impressed cos trying to follow the arrows is hard,,,, but after going back to a visual aid primary and then the GPS as an aid on top of that, it's fantastic,"
"Potentially a useful app for field spraying. Annoying how app always opens with map focused on some irrelevant location hundred of KMs away.  Needs a third option \"A,B point = None\" for those of us who don't need  lightbar guidance & just want to \"display sprayed area\" on the field. Unfortunately it will not connect to an external GPS on my Samsung S9+ running Android v9. App runs, but will not stay connected to Bad ELF BT GPS. Not obvious in the main interface which GPS is in use, therefore first you know of it dropping external GPS is when the steering commands go all weird. Be great if u can fix compatibility with late model Samsung phone and external GPS's."
"When i first dowloaded this app i woukd have given it a 10 out of 5. It was awesome. The reason i have rated it this low is now when i go to open it does not load and crashes. I have uninstalled, then re-booted phone, and re-installled. Works once and crashes. I will gladly give another chance and use if bugs can be sorted out - fingers crossed. Just to add, i have not removed yet. Hoping to see a fix before i have to take that action<U+0001F937><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F><U+0001F914>"
"Good app and just started using it today. I had a couple of issues. One field didn't highlight after I saved it, tried everything I could think of. Also when I forwarded to my brother the saved fields he said the acres of each didn't show on his end. Plan to keep using it for now."
"This app does a great job and is very useful for my field spraying. My only doing on it is I wish the tutorial was more descriptive or there was a really good video on how to set it up. I stumbled through it but figured it out. They recommend the Garmin GLO GPS bluetooth to use with it. Yes - it's worth it!"
"I bought this on a whim the other day while I was pulling an implement in a field and it's almost useless as a stand alone unit. It does work although the inital stated accuract is 9 meters, almost as big as the implement I was pulling. If the additional GPS external attenna gets the correction down to .3 meter that's the same as my 30 year old Trimble WASS batwing. Cheaper I guess but you think 30 years of technology advancement would get you more"
"I cannot get any customer service response after emailing them several times.  I like the app, however am trying to find an external gps antenna that is compatible to provide \"realtime\" tracking.  I am experiencing 5-8 second latency."
"Easy enough interface, easy to read descriptions and find what you're looking for. GPS mapping is off a bit but that could be my phone or service provider. Still figuring out ways to utilize field navigator and all of its applications."
"Hello colleagues. The app works great. Has some very good features. I would indeed increase the accuracy of the signal with some external antenna. Please be good to suggest something that will bring the accuracy under 100sm. Good luck"
"Been using this app a while now. Very useful. Having problem when saving track it should have a default track name like time and date which could be changed later. I've lost more than half my tracks when trying to save them."
"Worked great for over a year using Garmin GLO2 as an antenna. Today it crashed 6 times in the field after lagging terribly. Works fine for a few minutes then closes. Uninstall, reinstall, same thing. Has there been an update?"
"Hi, I am trying to use Your app, but have been experiencing difficulties.  When I launch the app, after about 10minutes of spraying, it starts to seriously Lag. Even when I stop, save the track, clear memory, launch the app again and continue, it lags even sooner.  I have tried using the app on: 1. Xiami Redmi Note 5 Pro, 2018, API level 28, 2. Lenovo Tab4, LENOVO Lenovo TB-X304F. API level 27 It seems to work on the xiaomi, but not on the tablet. Could it be a hardware issue?"
"Works really accurately plotting from Google earth images but driving around an area it was not as good. Could have been the low memory phone I was using which couldn't keep up."
"Best app for field navigation i have tried. There is space for improvement, like adding tilt correction for positioning would be nice, also heading projection in turns would help as well."
"works great for 20-30 mins than it slows to a crawl and finally locks up. once you restart it works again but all of your sprayed data is lost. I would appreciate help from the devoloper. using garmin glo."
"It's a good app for keeping track of the area you're working on, just comes down to the accuracy of your GPS. I have a GPS booster I'll be trying. Was still a good guide when doing cultivating at night."
"A great tool for farming. I mainly use it to indicate where I've fertilised rather than planning and following the calculated route. Probably due to the irregular and small size of my paddocks. Would benefit greatly from decent operating instructions. I would then award 5 stars."
"Excellent application. I use it on a Samsung. I have a smartphone Blu Studio Mega LTE and it's said is not compatible. Any suggestions on running it on this device."
"So far so good. Just installed it on my phone and ran around our one field close to our house to map an area and it surprisingly accurate for using the GPS on my phone alone. If this app proves to be helpful for our farm operations we will consider getting an add on bluetooth GPS unit."
"just getting to grips with this app once I got learn how to use it there's one thing that you could do with ab straight is good got a Garmin gol 2 accuracy is down to 0.3 metres. one thing that would be very helpful is an ab Curve line is that coming anytime soon"
"I like it . It does most of the stuff I want . Only bug or issue is that when i want to make my lines for gps my dot to show where i am is not actually where I am so that is one of the main reasons i use this but it doesnt work that well. If you can fix it than i would be verry glad.l"
"Got me through in a tight spot doing leucaena rows 10 m spacing. Wish it could handle curves. Had to make smaller areas then change direction."
"I bought a garmin glo gps receiver to get the best accuracy that I could. Still not nearly as accurate as the developers claim. Maybe they got the decimal point on the wrong side of the 3. Garmin gives a 3 meter accuracy rating for the garmin glo, so why does farmis give it a .3 meter accuracy rating? Update I use this app for spreading fertilizer. It's definitely better than guessing how far apart to drive. Makes the fertilizer rate come out pretty close."
"This app has gotten better over the years but you definitely have to spend some money on a good gps receiver to use it"
"It says \"Your location is unknown\", but I allowed GPS access. I tried to uninstall/restart a few times, but no success. I'm using a OnePlus 7T with Oxygen OS 10.0.7 Thank you !"
"Used once so far while cutting with batwing. Placed gaps a few times on some passes, even though I didn't miss my overlaps on each pass. Still need to use some more."
"this made fertilizing easy. I haven't used all the features yet but as far as i can tell from my first use it was pretty user friendly. I'm spraying later this week and i will definitely use this tool."
"Seems very cool! I can't seem to get it to save my track. Just asks for a name, no way to hit save or go back. Have to restart the app. Anyone else having this problem?"
"Terrible. The app won't let me import a KML file. And I know it isn't currupted because GPS fields area measure uses the same KML file just fine. The app says the file is corrupted when importing. And SHP file will also not import correctly."
"Relatively easy to use and fairly straightforward. Makes life much easier when you work ground and need to know an exact acreage"
"Works very well. I use it in my business to measure fields and prepare my invoices. Have checked it against government maps and it is always close or right on the mark. Will continue to use"
"The app is perfect <U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FD>... I'm giving it four stars instead of five because there's only one thing missing... If only it could have projections of inputs as well then I could give it five stars <U+2728>"
"Works good with receiver, comparable to other guidance. Works excellent paired with RTK base. If you run empty with an application you can come back months later (with the RTK set up) to finish and puts you spot on. Really like how you can record any application from field work, planting to harvest and go back any time and see your work and print out a report. Very easy to use but took a bit of communication from FieldBee to know how to set up."
"The app works better than others I have tried. I like the fact that it paints your track with the boom width instead of just a line. I had some difficulty getting it to work right the first 2 times, not extremely intuitive, but I eventually got it. It is very difficult to get the Ap to let go of your phone when you want to do multitasking, like rewind your audio book. I wants to save and close the App no matter what I do. It has a little lag time from course change on tractor to adjust the track and the new course displayed. That is a bit annoying, but for the most part, I like it enough to upgrade to the paid version to reward the programmer and maybe allow the program to evolve."
"Very good app.Easy to install. I work with L2 receiver. The only problem is after some time 1-2 hours the signal in the application becomes slow in relation to machine 5-10 sec. this is very bad because the correction it gives you is from 5 sec back. I don' t know if is the app or the receiver. I communicated with e farmer 2 weeks ago and i have not answer yet!!"
"Hi, It looks great, with a host of useful features and very active support. You can create and synchronise fields with the FieldBee WEB APP on your 'puter. I had problems accessing the WEB APP, but the support crew at FieldBee were excellent and remedied the issue promptly. I will update this review with further details after giving it a spin around a paddock or two."
"It works good still learning . Really like the updated app with numbered guidance lines. Works great with a better areial. Only issue I had was getting no reply when I had some issues , eventually figured them out. All in all a very good purchase."
"Downloaded, installed get stuck on a screen where it was ' setting a few things up'. Tried two installs. Same result. Uninstalled and moved on."
"Field bee is a good app for me at this time. If I were needing to get extremely close as GPS app, I would need something else, but for now it's just what I need. I do have a Garmin road GPS unit it get a bit closer (I take it runs from same satellites)"
"Easy to use and save your field information. I recommend this app for all kinds of uses. Ie. Fencing, landscaping, calculating seed and fertilizer..."
"There are so many good reviews, I would love to use this app. However I can't even get past the log in stage or create an account. There is no option to contact for assistance <U+0001F914>"
"Really good app does exactly what you need when seeding,spraying, fertilizing and more. easy to use"
"Works great. I only used the GPS on my phone with does not have the accuracy of stand alone gps but Fielder recommends using one."
"Good app for tracking in the field, keeping up with progress and time spent."
"Really good app, really helps me alot without having to buy any expensive equipment, recommended it to all the farmers i know"
"Have a question. Is there a Bluetooth GPS antenna besides the ones shown that will work with this app?"
"I couldn't connect with external bluetooth GPS. Can I do this?"
"Terrible, barely tracked the GPS location and a pain in the butt to use effectively"
"great app. very easy to learn but has a lot of great features."
"Great app but I'm struggling on how to use it properly. My lines aren't even straight when using it. Guess I'm a stupid retard ."
"It's good as long as you can navigate fields properly"
"Works great, accurate and easy to use."
"The best guidance app available for Android"
"Good basic (free gps)"
"Works okay, I need to fine tune it"
"Import fields not functional with kml or shp zip as indicated"
"A ok .. new to understand but learning"
"This app is difficult to opperate and do as it please"
"First time to use it. It was good to see were I had been in the field."
"Still learning but so far I like it."
"It was very good to work with"
"accurate gps guidance"
"Great app. Very helpful"
"Still working with it and myself"
"When is tilt compensation coming up?"
"The app wont let me create an account"
"Easy to use"
"Very promising application"
"First impression is good"
"Very good app"
"Exactly what I needed."
"so far so good"
"Just started using it."
"Am cumparat de la ei receptorul L2, licenta aplicatie pe 3 ani. Initial mi-au zis ca nu am nevoie de semnal RTK pentru ghidaj manual, apoi dupa prima plangere au zis altceva. Am facut abonament la NTRIP provider (pentru RTK) si degeaba... se blocheaza si nu pot folosi nimic. Suportul tehnic nu m-a ajutat, chiar m-au blocat pe whatsapp. Mai bine va cumparati un sistem profesional decat sa dati banii pentru a testa un sistem incert :) Nu recomand!"
"Ótimo! Ainda estou aprendendo a usar, mas fiquei feliz pois mesmo sem conexão lá no campo e sem receptor algum de sinal, consegui usá-lo. Tenho que praticar mais... parabéns pelo app."
"Very useful"
"La mejor apps para navegación con tractor, la recomiendo al 100%"
"nice app"
"Temperamental"
"Very good"
"good"
"Very good"

"It is very bad apps"
"Getting started and loving so far. Support was fantastic and fast"
"Keps all you info in one place"
"Great  app have it for more than a year and it is great"
"Fantastic so far"
"Customer support never could fix the issue of when I tried to use the app it placed me in a field 250 miles west of my location after a few attempts they simple stop responding. Since that time the free trial has expired and no way am I paying for something that's none functioning."
"The best farm records app!"
"Great"
"Junk When you try to log in it says password incorrect, when you reset the password it still says denied!!"
"Excellent Great app with tremendous potential to automate all record keeping on the farm. The best solution I have come across."
"Ideal farm app This has changed the way we approach record keeping and farm management. I have recommended  it to everyone I can. Very user friendly. Great company"
"love it makes my day on the farm so much easier. i dont have to go looking for information in different places. it is all in 1 app. thank you"
"Not free"
"Best ag app I've found for free"
"Best farm management app The more I explore this app and the online dashboard, the less need I have for separate spreadsheets to keep various records. Very good farm journal, scouting, material stock and others. Keep up the good work."
"can not even turn off the trial. or get the plotter to work. not very user friendly."
"Good app It needs a place for equipment and  maintainence, and uses too much battery life. but awesome app"
"Good app Farmers friendly app"
"I mainly use the app for mapping fields as a farm worker and don't use all the features it offers. You can basically keep track of everything you do in your fields. I like it that I can map fields out, give them names and look at them later before we go to work there so we no how much product to take. We custom spread fertilizer so is very helpful when you can't remember all the different farmers fields. I also like it that these guys keep updating their stuff. I know they are still improving their product."
"On efficiency the most useful apps I have on my phone The app is a great help when at fertilizer and it is very user friendly just wish the gps was a bit more accurate but that's why you are asked to buy the antenna. Despite this it is very useful but it needs a better tutorials or a help section  a youtube video how to work would be a good help"
"When I first download this app it was great, since it has repeatedly updated now the app no longer allows me to log in meaning the app is useless because I cannot gain access to use it. If the login issues are fixed and the app is useful again I will re-rate it at a 5"
"How do you delete a field??"
"Simple to use , great information and great way to store field and operation records , I use this system simply only as an operator and not for administration but however this tool could be a valuable asset to a large multi operator business synchronised with administration through a central hub ! I rate this app very highly and recommend it to anyone in the agriculture and perhaps even horticultural trade ! I look forward to the future to see what other developments efarmer brings !"
"Love it!"
"Great app I work for a farmer that has around 35000 acres and this is a great app to have to map and save fields so you know where they are. Really handy"
"Great Just amazingly helpful"
"Awesome"
"Great Fast support. Very nice map functionality. Regular improvements. Easy to use."
"Puikus supportas! Programa daro tai, ko iš jos tikejausi, labai patogu naudotis plotu brežimu. Kai kilo klausimu - per pora minuciu gavau visus atsakymus. Linkiu kad butu taip ir toliau"
"Long time user just glitches out There is a major glitch with marking out fields.  I place three markers then the fourth changes the whole shape and renders the attempt useless.  Please fix,  it was working great.  I'm using Galaxy note 3"
"A++++ customer service!!!! By far this is best farming  app I have used. I had some trouble figuring couple things out so I emailed them and they immediately helped me and took care of it for me. All my coworkers are linked to it so we all use the same maps and info. Thx for a GREAT app!!!"
"Excelente Muy buena plicacion para medir terrenos y hacerle seguimiento a diferentes cultivos."
"Awesome app This app works well,  for our ops. Please consider adding a farm perimeter as well we have 24 different farms that we work on and it would be handy to have that function, and also allow to tap on field no to show details,  thanks again..."
"Helpfulll"
"Great App I've been looking for something like this for a long time would be nice if we can add a photo to each task, that way its easy for us to recall that activity. Thanks"

"good gps"
"Fantastic"
"App won't install on your desk top untill you add a property or field. But it's almost impossible to add a guild, because when you go into the map, the names of the towns are the same colorscas the fields, AND no matter how much you enlargevtge feild or map, the size of the name of the town still stays very smalls,and the same color as the field!!! Would be better if u could enlarge the size of the town names as u enlarged the maps, & would help if town names were in black, & roads drawn in too."
"Uninstalled because it does not work at all. Does not find any satellite data."
"Amazing app, however after latest updates (probably since offline functionality was added) the interface is extremely slow and laggy and by that I mean it takes a lot of time from clicking on a field to when the app displays the field's ndvi image. I have an 8 core cpu and 6 gb ram so phone hw is not a problem. Kindly ask you to address this issue. Later review: I can confirm that as 27/01/2021, the app works smooth and I therefore can give 5 stars. Many thanks to the team, amazing work."
"this app is God sent...let's you record all farming activity and view all available NDVI images of the chosen field. not only that, it also lets you see the NDVI image of all available dates. I can track the progress of my crop by viewing all the images and highlight areas that are of low productivity. I hope you guys also add in other filters like EVI. That would be really great. thank you."
"Love this app! Helps you with any issues with drought or too much watering. Satellite feeds. To give you accurate info for managing crops & balancing fertilizer placement. Weeding and feeding There is a lot more features than this. If your having issues with growing issues that need to be solved this app is a definite help. Best times to spray herbicides. Wind issues & weather."
"This is a great app. I can monitor vegetation dynamics and weather at my fields from any location without necessarily visiting them. It allows to now precipitation, wind speed, dew point, temperature, predicts growth stages. Extremely useful. I highly recommend it."
"Very useful and user friendly - would it be able to see crops (estimated) of different lands from previous years?"
"Good app. Yet to improve on map accuracy. Need to enable user to input coordinates of a field. More crop to be added in the list."
"Absolutely exceptional use OneSoil every day in the field a credit to everyone that has made this happen. I am extremely grateful and really proud to be part of this Scouting system it has truly changed our business for the future. Kind regards Tim."
"The map is very old and out dated like 3 years or more behind. Map still shows old grass land that have been converted to field about 4 years ago. Not so great!"
"Highly recommended. Its maps are clear and accurate, absolutely worth trying."
"Hello, very interesting work is made by onesoil team. I personally, very much I've contact them for some technical details and the person has shown a high professional level. Thank you one soil and I hope you integrate Morocco <U+0001F1F2><U+0001F1E6>."
"You say that every 3-5 days new satelite photo comes, but how come I see only 2015 or even older photo instead? Idea quite good, but realisation not even close."
"Intuitive and friendly from first login. Suggested to some relatives who could use it more than I do."
"Sorry but the app doesn't load, just a white screen with logo."
"It real helps me monitor my fields. Very useful app."
"The app is really good but i wish we could change the colour of borders which is only yellow"
"Useful and reliable app. Works well and does the job. Kudos"
"Great free app with some functions of other paid apps works great here in Australia <U+0001F91F>"
"Easy to use and useful application for crop monitoring"
"great app to work with and its free... so easy to load paddocks and info"
"It has been a valuable tool for monitoring and defining irrigation. Deficiencies are visible and irrigation blocks have been rearranged according to NDVI and contrasted NDVI, previously identified soil differences within a field have been confirmed."
"Not bad. I am still waiting offline function. We work near border of republic. There are no internet."
"Crashed 1st try"
"Useful and very easy to use."

"One of the best app and I am using it from many years I have learnt many new thing for my home garden, if you are passionate about gardening then you should definitely try this application ."
"I paid for one year subscription and then I renewed and agreed to a year beyond that, but when I got my new phone it won't let me access any of the information that I saved on hundreds of plants from last summer. So I say don't waste your money they'll try to trap you in!!!"
"Nice and excellent apps of my first day experience... But needs little more addition.. Choices should be more than 10 crops included.. However, great feeling in using this apps. The founder/planner must be rewarded both in this world and also after leaving this world..."
"Plantix is most helpful for the beginners those are not at all experience in firming also ! Iam very glad to say that l will have the era which I was seeking badly. I hope, it will help me a lot."
"Seems like it has the potential to be a really great app. Visually appealing and cool features! Also user friendly. However I was a bit disappointed when I saw how limited the crop options were. Most of the options most likely would not be grown by someone at home for personal use. I was only able to choose beans and tomatoes, but I also have broccoli, kale, radish, spinach, parsley and basil in my yard. Will upgrade to 5 stars when more options available!"
"Nice and effective ap. By uploading the photograph of the affected plant, one could get suggestions of what insectide to use and in what quantity. The highlight is that they give suggestions for using natural inseticides also."
"This app is very helpful. I really liked the feature wherein you get to know which disease is affecting the plant just by clicking the picture."
"Interesting application. Description of the diseases are in detail. Remedies are in both organically and inorganically."
"Great experience bur need to cover more crops. Always need more definition tools for the aphids"
"Very helpful for the crops fertilizers and bugs problems and I recommend it to each and every plant lover."
"A very good app. Every farmers should maintain it to get the benefits."
"Very useful for every farmer and guidance about all kind of disease control ."
"appreciable effort from developer and their team to build this masterpiece app i like this app its usefull to get diagnose the problem with plant while taking picture of your plant"
"The best app ever.!! Excellent work keep it up."
"Nice app, I'm new to this game and I have noticed some problems with crops on the land. Plantix seems to be getting it right and helping to clear the problems. Thanks for this app, keep up the hard work guys and girls! <U+0001F49A>"
"Today I updated app afterwards I am unable to open notifications in community, whenever I click on notification symbol then app automatically closes itself. Everytime it is happening so fix this bug."
"One of the best agri and horti app, explore more in this app using all the beneficial tools cultivation tips helps me a lot, but for certain crops like BANANA , CABBAGE there's no cultivation tips. Please add cultivation tips for all the Major crops."
"Good app 3as there is always some room for improvement......like you can add upvote feature in reply section so that if an scholar person agrees with someone they don't have to make a new comment also the photo of the scholar also should be shown beside the reply"
"Great efforts <U+0001F44C> ....keep it up and keep it free <U+0001F604>"
"Really good app.. awesome materials are there .. instantly diagnosis of diseases are really appreciable.. Just need to work on the picture taking process <U+0001F920>.. Overall it's too nice <U+0001F499><U+0001F499>"
"Very Helpfull application and very easy to use"
"Very useful app !! I like the feature of pest and diseases and it's management and control. Also the package of practices of crops is very beneficial and also it proved to be very accurate. But the only downside is it's accuracy in terms of crop scanning. I used a lot of apps for farming but none of them was a feature rich app like Plantix !!"
"im having trouble being able to add the plants im growing and the app keeps saying that my profile cannot be found. I love the concept of the app but cant seem to use it the way its intended. maybe its a user error but I've tried doing a lot of different things to get it to work. I WOULD love to use this app though."
"Excellent work but please add mosambi crop"
"So nice the app and quick response no so much ad"
"Don't no but you have to strat in orgainic and goods purchases option in your app"
"Amazing app, especially with all the terrible, deceptive and outright abusive apps out there. Even if it does not support the crop yet, it offers help and advice. This happened one time out of probably 15 correct identifications. It's very responsive and easy to use. EDIT: Their support staff kinda kicks a** too."
"This is the Indian version of farmers almanac. App gives both biological and chemical controls which is a plus. Recognizes most of the deficiencies but not all pest problem but thats fine they are working on it, I can see the changes as a long time user. The problem is that it restricts the plant library according to the location and season. Every details or selection of plants needs to be available all the time and recommendation should be given on changing season thats more convenient."
"This app is very useful for the new learners. But also provide the meanings of words. In the sense in one state only different areas people will use different words, this would be a challenge for a farmer to understand if it in their local language also. Also provide the photos of pesticides as lot of farmers were not able to understand the biological terms. Thank you"
"I am very much connected to the idea. This app was an ad-suggestion by YouTube while watching a vedio, and I quickly got connected with the idea. I feel that this idea deserves an applause as you are trying to connect the dots between a farmer and an agricultural expert, which I believe never in the past was tried this efficiently. I haven't used the app yet , I just download it, but I am excited to use it. I hope the app doesn't disappoint."
"It needs to add a lot more vegetables and fruits to the \"select your crops\" or let us add & customize. Also seems like there are a lot of functions to this app, but not clear where or how to access. Has potential."
"1.It does not cover a lot of crops.. there r very few in it... 2. It crashes whenever i take a picture of infected leave of a plant.. return back to home page with no result. So much disappointed that i m going to uninstall it.. Worst experience"
"Audio not showing in app"
"Good app and I like how u have people from all over with answers I like that it's good for me to get more than 1 answers and possible solutions."
"The problem is solved quickly & Proper information is provided, One of the good features is that if you search for a photo of any crop or fruit, you will get the answer immediately and The solution is also suggested there so it is better to decide what to do next."
"Just downloaded it today and it really great. it was very helpful for my extension work. Would have been very happy if more of tropical crops were/are included in this app. They should optimize it by countries so that crop can easily be identified and proper diagnostic of crop. Good work by the team."
"Wow, this is a wonderful app and help me a lot . As I am newly in the farming sector and doesn't having that much of knowledge about the farming. These app gives me a complete guidance about the crops, it's management, harms and controls. And the weathered Cliemets. I hartly thanks to this app and team for these great effort towards the farming sector."
"Only using this app are photos on my phone not completely in focus. Was finally able to upload some pretty obvious photos of scale mite which the app couldn't identify. Disappointing."
"I hav really enjoying using this app ever, it even guide whether if you can apply pesticides or not."
"I like plastic as because of its quick and valuable response and advice."
"App is very nice and good work is app he app is very good working and best thinking reports<U+0001F60A><U+0001F44D><U+0001F44D>"
"App is not working properly,even l am not getting any information like mustered crop and others.."
"Useless app for me. The app asks you to pick top 4 crops you are interested in and its really frustrating that you are forced to select from a VERY limited collection of crops that dont include the ones i want like kale, spinach, garlic, broccoli, beets."
"Very nice apps its a docyor for all plants"
"Completely wrong identification and not given to the solution this app only for fertilizer shops advertising purpose so friends don't install this app"
"Very helpful for all crops"
"Good service to formes"
"It is very useful for farmers those who educated well"
"I think its the best app for agriculture. Had a bug in the app after updating, the plantix team was responsive enough in helping me getting it fixed. Really appreciate. Advisory feature was not showing even after several updates, all it needed was uninstalling and reinstalling again."
"I absolutely love this app! The community of people are so right there to help you out when you have a question and are very insightful. They are also very accepting of your input as well and to date I have not seen anyone shame anyone for a possibly incorrect answer or anything. However, I wish there were 2 things I could change about it though.... I wish there were more plant identification, I also wish that categories were added rather than just things that yields edible contents"
"Wouldn't accept any of my pictures of my sick tomato. \"Too blurry\" \"too far away\" etc etc. I never even was able to use it because it wouldn't accept anything. Good idea but the app isn't friendly to phones aren't the absolute newest with the best camera."
"This app is very usefull to farmers as well as Dealers, We can get Effective Solutions about Agriculture , Plantation related Problems. I am a Agri Input Dealer and as per my Knoledge everyone should install this App & get Solutions of their Problems.. Thank you Plantix"
"Very handy app, awesome idea, and I hope it is continued to be updated and improved. My biggest concern with the app is potentially misdiagnosis of plants. The app doesn't ask basic questions that could instantly solve most problems beginner gardners will have. How often do you water? How often do you fertilize? What is your soil mixture? What all have you done to help the plant already? Did you water more or apply more nutrients? Transplant? Overtrim it?"
". I love to read about plants . Thanks plantix app . To help me for more information about plants ."
"Good to diagnose the problems in plants, very helpful"
"Really informative and easy to use"
"I had a query regarding my plant which was suffering from a insect infestation. The problem was there from some years. I decided to try plantix. I posted the problem and the solution was given in the community within minutes. Thanks a lot Plantix and its helpful community."
"This portal on plants, finding the identity, the disease, the remedy is really help full, at the same time needs to be more educative, at times the subscribers send photo of plants and it is very diffocult for the soft ware to identify from.the photo, like today, I sent a photo-shot small baby apple plant which was showing curling of its leave with wrinkles, it could not be diagnosed correctly as to what could be cause. However, the site is very help full. thanks. - ram sridharan."
"Super app. Great idea. Very useful"
"It's very useful for cultivation guidens per new farmers aswell experienced farmers."
"Good forming service"
"Very interesting app, even for me who is a novice and just want to learn things about plants. The community is very well informed and always have some good advices. The UI of the app is perfect, good job!"
"Excellent app,I have had a terrace garden comprising of 100/125 plants in pots for over 10 years. All this time I was at the mercy of the gardener/ mali, with his limited knowledge,now all that has changed due to Plantix app,kudos to you. The community concept is awesome and people are very helpful. Wish I could source plants ,seeds,and insecticide/ pesticides from this app. It would complete the circle."
"Really great app. It helped me with the problems I was facing in my small kitchen garden. They have huge,well researched and catalogued database. Very efficient, do keep up the great work you are doing."

"The app is amazing. Love the community feature especially. I would love to see a tab in the profile page where the users can view the questions they have posted so far so that it will be easier to track. That would be really useful. Thanks!"
"it's an excellent app. the information will reach to almost all remote areas and now it is possible to transfer the technology from lab to land on massive. But it should available in all local languages as all the farmers are not knowing English"
"This app may be the best app I have on my phone. I live in an area where there seems to be a lot of plant fungus the owners prior to me had a garden and this has been a struggle. So many diseases look similar this app has helped tremendously diagnosing my plant diseases"
"A very Nice Application for Growers and Agriculture Extension Workers , No waiting for delayed reply to peasent, An accurate guide on spot ."
"Till today whatever I have asked plantix (in whatsapp) it has replied only this \"I am sorry, but I am not sure and don't want to tell you anything that is not correct <U+0001F614> But please try it again with another image\". I have uninstalled app as it is of no use. I am entomologist I know what problem is with plants. When I upload the photo to plantix, it doesn't identify even major pest and diseases. Really I don't know what good it is for. How helpful it is to farmers."

"Its a very good application we can use it for early detection of disease, pest and leaf damage."
"Wow so cool, I actually forgot what plants I planted in what pots because it's my first year and there is always something we forget todo lol. Well it told me my plants were tomatoes and I am so glad because I don't want them next to my peppers lol. The plant was still very young so I was jumping up and down when it figured it out. Thank you btw the camera was blurry when taking the pic thru the app but I did it anyway cause I thought maybe it's the technology they use. The picture still worked"
"Excellent app. Very useful to farmers and students"

"Even better with the latest updates. Well done xarvio team"
"It is very useful, accurate information I got from this app. Good experience."
"This app is terrible. If you are looking for an accurate scouting app do not download this! I downloaded it to help identify diseases in corn and soybean fields yet the algorithm has not been able to give any results at all! The weed ID is terrible, I used it on some simple weeds that were isolated in fields and the app got them wrong every time. It identified prickly sida as redroot pigweed and waterhemp as common purslane."
