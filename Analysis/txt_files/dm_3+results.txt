"Terrible. Dont waste your time. I tested against measured distances. It wasn't even close. The app had difficulty in accurately locating the start point under clear sky conditions (ie no overhead trees, clear sky day) I walked a 90 ft measured line multiple times with the app. Results were from 68 to 126 ft. Couldnt reproduce the same measurement even once. The app occasionally cant accurately locate at the beginning of the measure. Off by miles in some cases.
