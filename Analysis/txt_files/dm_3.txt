"Wont let me add farm says invalid shape Im uninstalling now waste of time"
"Tells you that you have to upgrade to use the app, after entering information on animal. Waste of time. If you are going to charge to use this app then put the price in the app store so people don't waste their time."
"Hi. Does the app allow me to upload existing maps with geometries? Like shapefile or gpx? It would be very helpfull since i already have the files and i will not waste time to draw all fields again. Thanks!"
"Do not waste your time or money you can get countless others for free that are exactly the same . no reason to be paying it's been a year now since I 1st downloaded this and I somehow accidentally paid the $55 for a full year subscription which I tried to cancel immediately and upon doing so really realized how much Of scam artist I was working with here they they refused to refund my money . It was not a half of a year later that is a lie and he knows it. I'll copy the emails and post here"
"Terrible. Dont waste your time. I tested against measured distances. It wasn't even close. The app had difficulty in accurately locating the start point under clear sky conditions (ie no overhead trees, clear sky day) I walked a 90 ft measured line multiple times with the app. Results were from 68 to 126 ft. Couldnt reproduce the same measurement even once. The app occasionally cant accurately locate at the beginning of the measure. Off by miles in some cases. Google maps would find me"
