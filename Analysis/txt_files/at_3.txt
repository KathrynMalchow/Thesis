"Seems like it has the potential to be a really great app. Visually appealing and cool features! Also user friendly. However I was a bit disappointed when I saw how limited the crop options were. Most of the options most likely would not be grown by someone at home for personal use. I was only able to choose beans and tomatoes, but I also have broccoli, kale, radish, spinach, parsley and basil in my yard. Will upgrade to 5 stars when more options available!"
"This app is really cool and features are too awesome. Easy to manage multiple fields in single app. Also easy to switch between different farms."
