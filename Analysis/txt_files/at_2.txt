"Very useful app !! I like the feature of pest and diseases and it's management and control. Also the package of practices of crops is very beneficial and also it proved to be very accurate. But the only downside is it's accuracy in terms of crop scanning. I used a lot of apps for farming but none of them was a feature rich app like Plantix !!"
"Till today whatever I have asked plantix (in whatsapp) it has replied only this \"I am sorry, but I am not sure and don't want to tell you anything that is not correct <U+0001F614> But please try it again with another image\". I have uninstalled app as it is of no use. I am entomologist I know what problem is with plants. When I upload the photo to plantix, it doesn't identify even major pest and diseases. Really I don't know what good it is for. How helpful it is to farmers."

"This portal on plants, finding the identity, the disease, the remedy is really help full, at the same time needs to be more educative, at times the subscribers send photo of plants and it is very diffocult for the soft ware to identify from.the photo, like today, I sent a photo-shot small baby apple plant which was showing curling of its leave with wrinkles, it could not be diagnosed correctly as to what could be cause. However, the site is very help full. thanks. - ram sridharan."
