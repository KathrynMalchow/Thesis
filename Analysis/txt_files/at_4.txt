"I am very happy with Bighaat application and it's services.Bighaat provides you quality and genuine products with reasonable price. Also, we will get different products like fertilizer, pesticides, etc (all in one). Thank you Bighaat and team."
"Now farming is as simple as we used to do by fetching products from this BiHaat application in reasonable price and quality. Don't go for negative comments as they had not practiced proper way. My experience is that I got my product even if it was unavailable. They called me and placed the order by themselves. T Its a good application which provide quality and accurate service to farmers as per their requirements. Thanks BigHaat. <U+0001F44D>"
"Firstly I said thanks to BigHaat. It is very useful to farmers for purchase of different types of seeds and the product quality is so good and reasonable prices. Customer care service is soo good. THANKS TO BigHaat."
"Good little app. Still using the free version as it does most of what I require. Allow curves and I will be paying for the Premium version... Clear and easy to read in use on a tractor and quite intuitive... which is rare. <U+0001F609> I use a Garmin Glo for a better level of accuracy, as the phone or tablet GPS only is not really accurate enough for fertiliser spreading. The app is not suitable without Egnos or RTK for spraying purposes. Would love to see a basic GIS mapping option and Records."
