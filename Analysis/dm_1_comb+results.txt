"It is SOOO close! This is exactly what I was looking for, but it needs much more work. (Thus only 3 stars for now). The navigation home screen (with the blue buttons) and the hidden left tool bar feel redundant of each other. Consolidating many related tabs would serve you well. There are far too many buttons to sort through for the average farmer who has stuff to do. Labeling buttons with icons in addition to the text would also be more user friendly. It would also be great to record/upload GPS data on fields and for maintenance routine purposes, share maps with GIS points to employee accounts. Employee accounts that can receive invites to my specific farm would be a great addition so you could assign a specific task to an individual. People would seriously pay money for this! Again, overall its a GREAT start to this app! I will keep it around in case you do update and will update stars as earned. I really want this to succeed. I know little about app development, but if you want real farmer suggestions, I'd be happy to elaborate!"
