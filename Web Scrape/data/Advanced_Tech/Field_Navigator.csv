Sam N,4,2019-10-09,"Great app, simple to use and clutter free interface. Are there any plans for curve guidance based on the last pass? Not all fields have straight edges here! Would also be good if you didn't have to create the field first, as when working as a contractor, you may go to fields you haven't been to before and not have time to set it up."
Gus L,1,2021-08-02,"Very frustrating. First of all, the highlight of the implement width does not show anywhere when you open the saved track. Only the line followed by the tractor on top of the other lines for the background map. Second when you try to select a track and share it as KML nothing happens. the share button for the tracks does not work. I can only share the full map but not the tracks that are the most imports thing for me for my spraying records. With this two issues the app is useless for me."
Jay Martin,4,2019-07-03,This app has proved very useful for spray and fertilizer applications for me. My work is involved with GPS mapping in the utility industry and I've worked with numerous GIS softwares. This app is good and I would love to see an option to add problem points to save in the field maps and/or the saved tracks to note rocks or sink holes for hay cutting. This would make it a 5 star rating! I've loaded the app for two of my hay buddies so far. Thank you!
Steve Rawlings,4,2019-12-07,"Good little app. Still using the free version as it does most of what I require. Allow curves and I will be paying for the Premium version... Clear and easy to read in use on a tractor and quite intuitive... which is rare. üòâ I use a Garmin Glo for a better level of accuracy, as the phone or tablet GPS only is not really accurate enough for fertiliser spreading. The app is not suitable without Egnos or RTK for spraying purposes. Would love to see a basic GIS mapping option and Records."
Steven Waller,5,2021-03-31,Excellent app. Still learning more as I go has lots of good features. Has good accuracy with phone gps in a Motorola but will buy an external gps soon to improve accuracy a little. Works amazing spraying a spreading pasture and hay fields always within the 1 feet as I use for my overlap. If you have had your phones gps turned off turn it on for a few minutes before begining to get a good results.
John Mann,3,2019-06-24,"Great potential but not there yet. Fields are created before navigating. Thats ok. But when those fields are navigated another day, the GPS signal is offset and the program leaves no way to fix it. Needs to be a way to correct GPS signal by going to a known spot and then telling the program where you really are. Also, Lightbar is hard to use. Need to be able to change resolution and size of Lightbar. Could add a poor man's rtk by using another android at a known location to send a data stream."
Francis Charette,4,2019-06-02,"all right, after using it for a bit, I was wondering why it didn't match any of my measuring wheel calcs that i walked around the fields with. it understated surface area by over 15% in some fields, up to 30% in the steepest one I have. Reason is, It doesn't do a 3d calculation of surface area that includes elevations! So basically just a rough calculation of flat surface areas. Makes a huge diff when spraying/planting... Maybe incorporate in next update? Thanks"
Brian Unrau,5,2019-05-20,"like it. has some nice features that I don't even have on my purchased navigation system that costs several thousand dollars, like being able to see the field on satellite image and being able to mark in field boundaries manually without driving around the field. thanks for building this product!"
A Google user,5,2019-01-17,"first time using GPS guidance glad I went with a free app instead of shelling out for a budget light bar setup, I assume it does the same thing, and at first wasn't impressed cos trying to follow the arrows is hard,,,, but after going back to a visual aid primary and then the GPS as an aid on top of that, it's fantastic,"
Ted Landy,3,2019-08-16,"Potentially a useful app for field spraying. Annoying how app always opens with map focused on some irrelevant location hundred of KMs away.  Needs a third option ""A,B point = None"" for those of us who don't need  lightbar guidance & just want to ""display sprayed area"" on the field. Unfortunately it will not connect to an external GPS on my Samsung S9+ running Android v9. App runs, but will not stay connected to Bad ELF BT GPS. Not obvious in the main interface which GPS is in use, therefore first you know of it dropping external GPS is when the steering commands go all weird. Be great if u can fix compatibility with late model Samsung phone and external GPS's."
Drew Tetz,1,2020-05-26,"When i first dowloaded this app i woukd have given it a 10 out of 5. It was awesome. The reason i have rated it this low is now when i go to open it does not load and crashes. I have uninstalled, then re-booted phone, and re-installled. Works once and crashes. I will gladly give another chance and use if bugs can be sorted out - fingers crossed. Just to add, i have not removed yet. Hoping to see a fix before i have to take that actionü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§î"
Brice Christians,4,2019-08-28,"Good app and just started using it today. I had a couple of issues. One field didn't highlight after I saved it, tried everything I could think of. Also when I forwarded to my brother the saved fields he said the acres of each didn't show on his end. Plan to keep using it for now."
I am Second,4,2019-09-03,This app does a great job and is very useful for my field spraying. My only doing on it is I wish the tutorial was more descriptive or there was a really good video on how to set it up. I stumbled through it but figured it out. They recommend the Garmin GLO GPS bluetooth to use with it. Yes - it's worth it!
James Jenkins,3,2020-05-06,"I bought this on a whim the other day while I was pulling an implement in a field and it's almost useless as a stand alone unit. It does work although the inital stated accuract is 9 meters, almost as big as the implement I was pulling. If the additional GPS external attenna gets the correction down to .3 meter that's the same as my 30 year old Trimble WASS batwing. Cheaper I guess but you think 30 years of technology advancement would get you more"
Billy Seal,5,2019-05-13,"I cannot get any customer service response after emailing them several times.  I like the app, however am trying to find an external gps antenna that is compatible to provide ""realtime"" tracking.  I am experiencing 5-8 second latency."
Red Falcon,4,2020-08-08,"Easy enough interface, easy to read descriptions and find what you're looking for. GPS mapping is off a bit but that could be my phone or service provider. Still figuring out ways to utilize field navigator and all of its applications."
Niki Zahariev,5,2021-04-13,Hello colleagues. The app works great. Has some very good features. I would indeed increase the accuracy of the signal with some external antenna. Please be good to suggest something that will bring the accuracy under 100sm. Good luck
Charles Boyd,5,2021-05-27,Been using this app a while now. Very useful. Having problem when saving track it should have a default track name like time and date which could be changed later. I've lost more than half my tracks when trying to save them.
Kevin DeWitt,3,2020-05-17,"Worked great for over a year using Garmin GLO2 as an antenna. Today it crashed 6 times in the field after lagging terribly. Works fine for a few minutes then closes. Uninstall, reinstall, same thing. Has there been an update?"
Jacint Ujlaky,5,2019-08-29,"Hi, I am trying to use Your app, but have been experiencing difficulties.  When I launch the app, after about 10minutes of spraying, it starts to seriously Lag. Even when I stop, save the track, clear memory, launch the app again and continue, it lags even sooner.  I have tried using the app on: 1. Xiami Redmi Note 5 Pro, 2018, API level 28, 2. Lenovo Tab4, LENOVO Lenovo TB-X304F. API level 27 It seems to work on the xiaomi, but not on the tablet. Could it be a hardware issue?"
Hugh Loxton,4,2018-09-22,Works really accurately plotting from Google earth images but driving around an area it was not as good. Could have been the low memory phone I was using which couldn't keep up.
Marko Glusac,4,2020-11-12,"Best app for field navigation i have tried. There is space for improvement, like adding tilt correction for positioning would be nice, also heading projection in turns would help as well."
Derek Porter,2,2019-01-13,works great for 20-30 mins than it slows to a crawl and finally locks up. once you restart it works again but all of your sprayed data is lost. I would appreciate help from the devoloper. using garmin glo.
Boothie nz,4,2021-05-18,"It's a good app for keeping track of the area you're working on, just comes down to the accuracy of your GPS. I have a GPS booster I'll be trying. Was still a good guide when doing cultivating at night."
Peter Wiseman,4,2021-04-29,A great tool for farming. I mainly use it to indicate where I've fertilised rather than planning and following the calculated route. Probably due to the irregular and small size of my paddocks. Would benefit greatly from decent operating instructions. I would then award 5 stars.
A Google user,5,2018-12-26,Excellent application. I use it on a Samsung. I have a smartphone Blu Studio Mega LTE and it's said is not compatible. Any suggestions on running it on this device.
Einar Zenka,5,2019-12-14,So far so good. Just installed it on my phone and ran around our one field close to our house to map an area and it surprisingly accurate for using the GPS on my phone alone. If this app proves to be helpful for our farm operations we will consider getting an add on bluetooth GPS unit.
jon tucker,5,2019-04-14,just getting to grips with this app once I got learn how to use it there's one thing that you could do with ab straight is good got a Garmin gol 2 accuracy is down to 0.3 metres. one thing that would be very helpful is an ab Curve line is that coming anytime soon
Gerhard Ferreira,4,2020-07-22,I like it . It does most of the stuff I want . Only bug or issue is that when i want to make my lines for gps my dot to show where i am is not actually where I am so that is one of the main reasons i use this but it doesnt work that well. If you can fix it than i would be verry glad.l
Lorraine Cherland,4,2020-02-21,Got me through in a tight spot doing leucaena rows 10 m spacing. Wish it could handle curves. Had to make smaller areas then change direction.
L M,3,2021-04-18,"I bought a garmin glo gps receiver to get the best accuracy that I could. Still not nearly as accurate as the developers claim. Maybe they got the decimal point on the wrong side of the 3. Garmin gives a 3 meter accuracy rating for the garmin glo, so why does farmis give it a .3 meter accuracy rating? Update I use this app for spreading fertilizer. It's definitely better than guessing how far apart to drive. Makes the fertilizer rate come out pretty close."
Jacob Gubbels,3,2022-03-27,This app has gotten better over the years but you definitely have to spend some money on a good gps receiver to use it
F K,1,2020-09-23,"It says ""Your location is unknown"", but I allowed GPS access. I tried to uninstall/restart a few times, but no success. I'm using a OnePlus 7T with Oxygen OS 10.0.7 Thank you !"
T Crutsinger,4,2019-11-04,"Used once so far while cutting with batwing. Placed gaps a few times on some passes, even though I didn't miss my overlaps on each pass. Still need to use some more."
Marcius rae,5,2019-05-14,this made fertilizing easy. I haven't used all the features yet but as far as i can tell from my first use it was pretty user friendly. I'm spraying later this week and i will definitely use this tool.
Matthew Francis,3,2020-12-20,"Seems very cool! I can't seem to get it to save my track. Just asks for a name, no way to hit save or go back. Have to restart the app. Anyone else having this problem?"
Adam Sherriff,1,2020-09-15,Terrible. The app won't let me import a KML file. And I know it isn't currupted because GPS fields area measure uses the same KML file just fine. The app says the file is corrupted when importing. And SHP file will also not import correctly.
Jordan Myers,4,2019-08-26,Relatively easy to use and fairly straightforward. Makes life much easier when you work ground and need to know an exact acreage
Anthony Herpeche,5,2020-03-21,Works very well. I use it in my business to measure fields and prepare my invoices. Have checked it against government maps and it is always close or right on the mark. Will continue to use
Tsatsi Ranthocha,4,2021-08-07,The app is perfect üëåüèΩ... I'm giving it four stars instead of five because there's only one thing missing... If only it could have projections of inputs as well then I could give it five stars ‚ú®
