Avinash Madhukar,5,2022-03-24,"One of the best app and I am using it from many years I have learnt many new thing for my home garden, if you are passionate about gardening then you should definitely try this application ."
Wendy Smilek,1,2022-01-24,"I paid for one year subscription and then I renewed and agreed to a year beyond that, but when I got my new phone it won't let me access any of the information that I saved on hundreds of plants from last summer. So I say don't waste your money they'll try to trap you in!!!"
RafiqN Khan,4,2022-01-29,"Nice and excellent apps of my first day experience... But needs little more addition.. Choices should be more than 10 crops included.. However, great feeling in using this apps. The founder/planner must be rewarded both in this world and also after leaving this world..."
Asim Kumar De,4,2022-02-17,"Plantix is most helpful for the beginners those are not at all experience in firming also ! Iam very glad to say that l will have the era which I was seeking badly. I hope, it will help me a lot."
Marirose Mazza,3,2020-05-11,"Seems like it has the potential to be a really great app. Visually appealing and cool features! Also user friendly. However I was a bit disappointed when I saw how limited the crop options were. Most of the options most likely would not be grown by someone at home for personal use. I was only able to choose beans and tomatoes, but I also have broccoli, kale, radish, spinach, parsley and basil in my yard. Will upgrade to 5 stars when more options available!"
Chathoth Sathish,4,2022-01-28,"Nice and effective ap. By uploading the photograph of the affected plant, one could get suggestions of what insectide to use and in what quantity. The highlight is that they give suggestions for using natural inseticides also."
Paramveer,5,2022-02-05,This app is very helpful. I really liked the feature wherein you get to know which disease is affecting the plant just by clicking the picture.
nimesh bhagat,4,2022-02-10,Interesting application. Description of the diseases are in detail. Remedies are in both organically and inorganically.
Mohamed Eissa,4,2022-02-24,Great experience bur need to cover more crops. Always need more definition tools for the aphids

Ali raza Khan,3,2022-02-21,appreciable effort from developer and their team to build this masterpiece app i like this app its usefull to get diagnose the problem with plant while taking picture of your plant

Kaos Wizard,5,2021-12-02,"Nice app, I'm new to this game and I have noticed some problems with crops on the land. Plantix seems to be getting it right and helping to clear the problems. Thanks for this app, keep up the hard work guys and girls! üíö"
Srinivas Golem,4,2021-10-30,"Today I updated app afterwards I am unable to open notifications in community, whenever I click on notification symbol then app automatically closes itself. Everytime it is happening so fix this bug."
Random Vid,4,2021-11-12,"One of the best agri and horti app, explore more in this app using all the beneficial tools cultivation tips helps me a lot, but for certain crops like BANANA , CABBAGE there's no cultivation tips. Please add cultivation tips for all the Major crops."
Ramkrishna pandey,3,2022-01-11,Good app 3as there is always some room for improvement......like you can add upvote feature in reply section so that if an scholar person agrees with someone they don't have to make a new comment also the photo of the scholar also should be shown beside the reply
Lakhan patidar,4,2022-03-14,Great efforts üëå ....keep it up and keep it free üòÑ

Pradeepta Swain,5,2022-03-11,Very Helpfull application and very easy to use
Yax Chavan,4,2020-05-03,Very useful app !! I like the feature of pest and diseases and it's management and control. Also the package of practices of crops is very beneficial and also it proved to be very accurate. But the only downside is it's accuracy in terms of crop scanning. I used a lot of apps for farming but none of them was a feature rich app like Plantix !!
A Google user,2,2019-01-09,im having trouble being able to add the plants im growing and the app keeps saying that my profile cannot be found. I love the concept of the app but cant seem to use it the way its intended. maybe its a user error but I've tried doing a lot of different things to get it to work. I WOULD love to use this app though.
VISWARUPA REDDY,5,2022-03-19,Excellent work but please add mosambi crop
Vincent Thole,4,2022-03-11,So nice the app and quick response no so much ad
Manjunathgowda Manjunathgowda,4,2022-02-05,Don't no but you have to strat in orgainic and goods purchases option in your app
Mike Johnson,5,2021-08-14,"Amazing app, especially with all the terrible, deceptive and outright abusive apps out there. Even if it does not support the crop yet, it offers help and advice. This happened one time out of probably 15 correct identifications. It's very responsive and easy to use. EDIT: Their support staff kinda kicks a** too."
Hashim T Abubacker,4,2020-01-10,"This is the Indian version of farmers almanac. App gives both biological and chemical controls which is a plus. Recognizes most of the deficiencies but not all pest problem but thats fine they are working on it, I can see the changes as a long time user. The problem is that it restricts the plant library according to the location and season. Every details or selection of plants needs to be available all the time and recommendation should be given on changing season thats more convenient."
Deveendra Reddy Reddam,5,2018-11-07,"This app is very useful for the new learners. But also provide the meanings of words. In the sense in one state only different areas people will use different words, this would be a challenge for a farmer to understand if it in their local language also. Also provide the photos of pesticides as lot of farmers were not able to understand the biological terms. Thank you"
sreenivasa lokesh,4,2019-04-24,"I am very much connected to the idea. This app was an ad-suggestion by YouTube while watching a vedio, and I quickly got connected with the idea. I feel that this idea deserves an applause as you are trying to connect the dots between a farmer and an agricultural expert, which I believe never in the past was tried this efficiently. I haven't used the app yet , I just download it, but I am excited to use it. I hope the app doesn't disappoint."
TheRealM,2,2020-05-22,"It needs to add a lot more vegetables and fruits to the ""select your crops"" or let us add & customize. Also seems like there are a lot of functions to this app, but not clear where or how to access. Has potential."
A Google user,1,2018-12-11,1.It does not cover a lot of crops.. there r very few in it... 2. It crashes whenever i take a picture of infected leave of a plant.. return back to home page with no result. So much disappointed that i m going to uninstall it.. Worst experience
venki alla,1,2022-02-19,Audio not showing in app
Chris Bunch,4,2022-01-22,Good app and I like how u have people from all over with answers I like that it's good for me to get more than 1 answers and possible solutions.
Manoj Sawant,5,2021-11-03,"The problem is solved quickly & Proper information is provided, One of the good features is that if you search for a photo of any crop or fruit, you will get the answer immediately and The solution is also suggested there so it is better to decide what to do next."
Francis Anang,4,2019-08-13,Just downloaded it today and it really great. it was very helpful for my extension work. Would have been very happy if more of tropical crops were/are included in this app. They should optimize it by countries so that crop can easily be identified and proper diagnostic of crop. Good work by the team.
Mahendra Thakare,4,2020-07-30,"Wow, this is a wonderful app and help me a lot . As I am newly in the farming sector and doesn't having that much of knowledge about the farming. These app gives me a complete guidance about the crops, it's management, harms and controls. And the weathered Cliemets. I hartly thanks to this app and team for these great effort towards the farming sector."
Jon Tse,1,2018-11-02,Only using this app are photos on my phone not completely in focus. Was finally able to upload some pretty obvious photos of scale mite which the app couldn't identify. Disappointing.
Clever Munsunge,3,2022-01-06,"I hav really enjoying using this app ever, it even guide whether if you can apply pesticides or not."

Sourabh Naik,5,2022-02-11,App is very nice and good work is app he app is very good working and best thinking reportsüòäüëçüëç
SAGEN KISKU,1,2022-01-30,"App is not working properly,even l am not getting any information like mustered crop and others.."
Gurinder Singh,1,2019-07-02,"Useless app for me. The app asks you to pick top 4 crops you are interested in and its really frustrating that you are forced to select from a VERY limited collection of crops that dont include the ones i want like kale, spinach, garlic, broccoli, beets."
Fabrice Muhinyuza,4,2022-03-07,Very nice apps its a docyor for all plants
g upender g upender,1,2022-01-26,Completely wrong identification and not given to the solution this app only for fertilizer shops advertising purpose so friends don't install this app

mohammed khan,5,2019-08-13,"I think its the best app for agriculture. Had a bug in the app after updating, the plantix team was responsive enough in helping me getting it fixed. Really appreciate. Advisory feature was not showing even after several updates, all it needed was uninstalling and reinstalling again."
Alicia Donnell,3,2020-09-25,"I absolutely love this app! The community of people are so right there to help you out when you have a question and are very insightful. They are also very accepting of your input as well and to date I have not seen anyone shame anyone for a possibly incorrect answer or anything. However, I wish there were 2 things I could change about it though.... I wish there were more plant identification, I also wish that categories were added rather than just things that yields edible contents"
Ashley McCammon,1,2021-06-03,"Wouldn't accept any of my pictures of my sick tomato. ""Too blurry"" ""too far away"" etc etc. I never even was able to use it because it wouldn't accept anything. Good idea but the app isn't friendly to phones aren't the absolute newest with the best camera."
Ananth Prabhu,4,2022-02-02,"This app is very usefull to farmers as well as Dealers, We can get Effective Solutions about Agriculture , Plantation related Problems. I am a Agri Input Dealer and as per my Knoledge everyone should install this App & get Solutions of their Problems.. Thank you Plantix"
Cory Pritchard,3,2020-04-11,"Very handy app, awesome idea, and I hope it is continued to be updated and improved. My biggest concern with the app is potentially misdiagnosis of plants. The app doesn't ask basic questions that could instantly solve most problems beginner gardners will have. How often do you water? How often do you fertilize? What is your soil mixture? What all have you done to help the plant already? Did you water more or apply more nutrients? Transplant? Overtrim it?"
Devi Lamare,4,2022-01-16,. I love to read about plants . Thanks plantix app . To help me for more information about plants .
Pramod Kumar,5,2022-02-01,"Good to diagnose the problems in plants, very helpful"

Sridhar G,5,2021-11-24,I had a query regarding my plant which was suffering from a insect infestation. The problem was there from some years. I decided to try plantix. I posted the problem and the solution was given in the community within minutes. Thanks a lot Plantix and its helpful community.
Ram Sridharan,4,2018-12-20,"This portal on plants, finding the identity, the disease, the remedy is really help full, at the same time needs to be more educative, at times the subscribers send photo of plants and it is very diffocult for the soft ware to identify from.the photo, like today, I sent a photo-shot small baby apple plant which was showing curling of its leave with wrinkles, it could not be diagnosed correctly as to what could be cause. However, the site is very help full. thanks. - ram sridharan."

All this time I was at the mercy of the gardener/ mali, with his limited knowledge,now all that has changed due to Plantix app,kudos to you. The community concept is awesome and people are very helpful. Wish I could source plants ,seeds,and insecticide/ pesticides from this app. It would complete the circle."

Elisheba,4,2021-03-11,The app is amazing. Love the community feature especially. I would love to see a tab in the profile page where the users can view the questions they have posted so far so that it will be easier to track. That would be really useful. Thanks!
Appa rao Killi,5,2019-05-18,it's an excellent app. the information will reach to almost all remote areas and now it is possible to transfer the technology from lab to land on massive. But it should available in all local languages as all the farmers are not knowing English
leah adcock,5,2021-07-10,This app may be the best app I have on my phone. I live in an area where there seems to be a lot of plant fungus the owners prior to me had a garden and this has been a struggle. So many diseases look similar this app has helped tremendously diagnosing my plant diseases
Sayed Saif Ullah Shah,5,2021-12-03,"A very Nice Application for Growers and Agriculture Extension Workers , No waiting for delayed reply to peasent, An accurate guide on spot ."
Vinod Kukanur,1,2020-12-30,"Till today whatever I have asked plantix (in whatsapp) it has replied only this ""I am sorry, but I am not sure and don't want to tell you anything that is not correct üòî But please try it again with another image"". I have uninstalled app as it is of no use. I am entomologist I know what problem is with plants. When I upload the photo to plantix, it doesn't identify even major pest and diseases. Really I don't know what good it is for. How helpful it is to farmers."
ge el es pe,5,2021-03-14,Usually it gives around 70 to 80 percent correct. It all depends on the right clear picture you input...but it's useful
Balu Pydi,1,2022-03-22,"No answers for quetions, plants problems"
siva krishna,5,2021-11-14,Very useful in detecting crop pests and suggesting control measures....
