Paul Jensen,2,2022-01-02,"App won't install on your desk top untill you add a property or field. But it's almost impossible to add a guild, because when you go into the map, the names of the towns are the same colorscas the fields, AND no matter how much you enlargevtge feild or map, the size of the name of the town still stays very smalls,and the same color as the field!!! Would be better if u could enlarge the size of the town names as u enlarged the maps, & would help if town names were in black, & roads drawn in too."
Scott Sweet,1,2022-03-03,Uninstalled because it does not work at all. Does not find any satellite data.
Iulian Blejusca,5,2021-01-27,"Amazing app, however after latest updates (probably since offline functionality was added) the interface is extremely slow and laggy and by that I mean it takes a lot of time from clicking on a field to when the app displays the field's ndvi image. I have an 8 core cpu and 6 gb ram so phone hw is not a problem. Kindly ask you to address this issue. Later review: I can confirm that as 27/01/2021, the app works smooth and I therefore can give 5 stars. Many thanks to the team, amazing work."
Uzma Ghazali,5,2019-06-21,"this app is God sent...let's you record all farming activity and view all available NDVI images of the chosen field. not only that, it also lets you see the NDVI image of all available dates. I can track the progress of my crop by viewing all the images and highlight areas that are of low productivity. I hope you guys also add in other filters like EVI. That would be really great. thank you."
Todd McDaniel,5,2020-06-04,Love this app! Helps you with any issues with drought or too much watering. Satellite feeds. To give you accurate info for managing crops & balancing fertilizer placement. Weeding and feeding There is a lot more features than this. If your having issues with growing issues that need to be solved this app is a definite help. Best times to spray herbicides. Wind issues & weather.
Anatolii Vasylchenko,5,2020-06-25,"This is a great app. I can monitor vegetation dynamics and weather at my fields from any location without necessarily visiting them. It allows to now precipitation, wind speed, dew point, temperature, predicts growth stages. Extremely useful. I highly recommend it."
Robert P,5,2022-01-20,Very useful and user friendly - would it be able to see crops (estimated) of different lands from previous years?
Sivakumar S,3,2021-10-06,Good app. Yet to improve on map accuracy. Need to enable user to input coordinates of a field. More crop to be added in the list.
Tim Brown,5,2021-09-17,Absolutely exceptional use OneSoil every day in the field a credit to everyone that has made this happen. I am extremely grateful and really proud to be part of this Scouting system it has truly changed our business for the future. Kind regards Tim.
Johan Vorster,1,2019-04-12,The map is very old and out dated like 3 years or more behind. Map still shows old grass land that have been converted to field about 4 years ago. Not so great!
Alfred Nilson,5,2019-04-24,"Highly recommended. Its maps are clear and accurate, absolutely worth trying."
Fouad Amine,5,2019-05-13,"Hello, very interesting work is made by onesoil team. I personally, very much I've contact them for some technical details and the person has shown a high professional level. Thank you one soil and I hope you integrate Morocco üá≤üá¶."
Justinas,2,2020-01-10,"You say that every 3-5 days new satelite photo comes, but how come I see only 2015 or even older photo instead? Idea quite good, but realisation not even close."
Francesco Scandola,5,2020-01-03,Intuitive and friendly from first login. Suggested to some relatives who could use it more than I do.

Pepe Lt,5,2021-10-25,"It has been a valuable tool for monitoring and defining irrigation. Deficiencies are visible and irrigation blocks have been rearranged according to NDVI and contrasted NDVI, previously identified soil differences within a field have been confirmed."
