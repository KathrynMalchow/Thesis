Explore World,2,2021-05-26,Worst follow up of order and inventory.. Half the products are not available even after a second wait although it shows it's available.Prices are very high comparing other sites. The team doesn't know what is available and what is not.No point ordering although everything else is attractive.If the situation was for one product it is understable but not for every second product.. Waste of money.. App ordering doesn't work with stock in hand (avaible)no notifications. Toll free number not working.
