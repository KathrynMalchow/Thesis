J,5,2022-03-14,"Works good with receiver, comparable to other guidance. Works excellent paired with RTK base. If you run empty with an application you can come back months later (with the RTK set up) to finish and puts you spot on. Really like how you can record any application from field work, planting to harvest and go back any time and see your work and print out a report. Very easy to use but took a bit of communication from FieldBee to know how to set up."
Michael McCoy,4,2020-05-28,"The app works better than others I have tried. I like the fact that it paints your track with the boom width instead of just a line. I had some difficulty getting it to work right the first 2 times, not extremely intuitive, but I eventually got it. It is very difficult to get the Ap to let go of your phone when you want to do multitasking, like rewind your audio book. I wants to save and close the App no matter what I do. It has a little lag time from course change on tractor to adjust the track and the new course displayed. That is a bit annoying, but for the most part, I like it enough to upgrade to the paid version to reward the programmer and maybe allow the program to evolve."
Alexandros B9hell,4,2021-03-23,Very good app.Easy to install. I work with L2 receiver. The only problem is after some time 1-2 hours the signal in the application becomes slow in relation to machine 5-10 sec. this is very bad because the correction it gives you is from 5 sec back. I don' t know if is the app or the receiver. I communicated with e farmer 2 weeks ago and i have not answer yet!!
Wahroonga Farm,5,2021-09-15,"Hi, It looks great, with a host of useful features and very active support. You can create and synchronise fields with the FieldBee WEB APP on your 'puter. I had problems accessing the WEB APP, but the support crew at FieldBee were excellent and remedied the issue promptly. I will update this review with further details after giving it a spin around a paddock or two."
Rob McW.,4,2019-06-07,"It works good still learning . Really like the updated app with numbered guidance lines. Works great with a better areial. Only issue I had was getting no reply when I had some issues , eventually figured them out. All in all a very good purchase."
Paul Borthwick,1,2020-06-15,"Downloaded, installed get stuck on a screen where it was ' setting a few things up'. Tried two installs. Same result. Uninstalled and moved on."
Kevin Gammill,4,2019-07-16,"Field bee is a good app for me at this time. If I were needing to get extremely close as GPS app, I would need something else, but for now it's just what I need. I do have a Garmin road GPS unit it get a bit closer (I take it runs from same satellites)"
Phill Grimes,5,2020-11-25,"Easy to use and save your field information. I recommend this app for all kinds of uses. Ie. Fencing, landscaping, calculating seed and fertilizer..."

Casey Shaw,5,2020-08-17,Have a question. Is there a Bluetooth GPS antenna besides the ones shown that will work with this app?
Luiz Fernando Capelezzo,3,2019-08-11,I couldn't connect with external bluetooth GPS. Can I do this?
Patrick Bleasdale,1,2020-06-03,"Terrible, barely tracked the GPS location and a pain in the butt to use effectively"

George Dumitru,1,2022-03-29,"Am cumparat de la ei receptorul L2, licenta aplicatie pe 3 ani. Initial mi-au zis ca nu am nevoie de semnal RTK pentru ghidaj manual, apoi dupa prima plangere au zis altceva. Am facut abonament la NTRIP provider (pentru RTK) si degeaba... se blocheaza si nu pot folosi nimic. Suportul tehnic nu m-a ajutat, chiar m-au blocat pe whatsapp. Mai bine va cumparati un sistem profesional decat sa dati banii pentru a testa un sistem incert :) Nu recomand!"
Luiz Ricardo,5,2022-01-03,"√ìtimo! Ainda estou aprendendo a usar, mas fiquei feliz pois mesmo sem conex√£o l√° no campo e sem receptor algum de sinal, consegui us√°-lo. Tenho que praticar mais... parab√©ns pelo app."

Daniel Lay,5,2017-11-30,Fantastic so far
Jeff W,1,2017-10-12,Customer support never could fix the issue of when I tried to use the app it placed me in a field 250 miles west of my location after a few attempts they simple stop responding. Since that time the free trial has expired and no way am I paying for something that's none functioning.
Jason and Erica Hornor,5,2017-04-23,The best farm records app!
maplasie johan,5,2017-02-19,Great
Brannon Stone,1,2016-09-05,"Junk When you try to log in it says password incorrect, when you reset the password it still says denied!!"
A Google user,5,2016-08-06,Excellent Great app with tremendous potential to automate all record keeping on the farm. The best solution I have come across.
Geert Lepoutre,5,2016-07-26,Ideal farm app This has changed the way we approach record keeping and farm management. I have recommended  it to everyone I can. Very user friendly. Great company
Riaan Weyers,4,2016-06-16,love it makes my day on the farm so much easier. i dont have to go looking for information in different places. it is all in 1 app. thank you
Balkrishna Chougule,2,2016-06-05,Not free
T H Kane,4,2016-04-07,Best ag app I've found for free
Cornel Ionita,5,2016-03-01,"Best farm management app The more I explore this app and the online dashboard, the less need I have for separate spreadsheets to keep various records. Very good farm journal, scouting, material stock and others. Keep up the good work."
James Obrien,1,2016-02-21,can not even turn off the trial. or get the plotter to work. not very user friendly.
Brad Y,4,2015-07-17,"Good app It needs a place for equipment and  maintainence, and uses too much battery life. but awesome app"
Prabhakar Kumar,5,2015-05-28,Good app Farmers friendly app
Ross Litwiller,5,2015-04-12,"I mainly use the app for mapping fields as a farm worker and don't use all the features it offers. You can basically keep track of everything you do in your fields. I like it that I can map fields out, give them names and look at them later before we go to work there so we no how much product to take. We custom spread fertilizer so is very helpful when you can't remember all the different farmers fields. I also like it that these guys keep updating their stuff. I know they are still improving their product."
Seamus Kenny,5,2015-04-11,On efficiency the most useful apps I have on my phone The app is a great help when at fertilizer and it is very user friendly just wish the gps was a bit more accurate but that's why you are asked to buy the antenna. Despite this it is very useful but it needs a better tutorials or a help section  a youtube video how to work would be a good help
Michael Stuckey Jr.,2,2015-02-09,"When I first download this app it was great, since it has repeatedly updated now the app no longer allows me to log in meaning the app is useless because I cannot gain access to use it. If the login issues are fixed and the app is useful again I will re-rate it at a 5"
bhargav rayeni,5,2014-10-14,How do you delete a field??
colin lewis,5,2014-09-14,"Simple to use , great information and great way to store field and operation records , I use this system simply only as an operator and not for administration but however this tool could be a valuable asset to a large multi operator business synchronised with administration through a central hub ! I rate this app very highly and recommend it to anyone in the agriculture and perhaps even horticultural trade ! I look forward to the future to see what other developments efarmer brings !"
Mark Allen,5,2014-09-18,Love it!
Kaleb Miller,5,2014-09-08,Great app I work for a farmer that has around 35000 acres and this is a great app to have to map and save fields so you know where they are. Really handy

Crawford Peitso,2,2014-02-17,"Long time user just glitches out There is a major glitch with marking out fields.  I place three markers then the fourth changes the whole shape and renders the attempt useless.  Please fix,  it was working great.  I'm using Galaxy note 3"
indiana jones,5,2014-03-25,A++++ customer service!!!! By far this is best farming  app I have used. I had some trouble figuring couple things out so I emailed them and they immediately helped me and took care of it for me. All my coworkers are linked to it so we all use the same maps and info. Thx for a GREAT app!!!
A Google user,5,2014-01-04,Excelente Muy buena plicacion para medir terrenos y hacerle seguimiento a diferentes cultivos.
Leon Mouton,5,2013-09-03,"Awesome app This app works well,  for our ops. Please consider adding a farm perimeter as well we have 24 different farms that we work on and it would be handy to have that function, and also allow to tap on field no to show details,  thanks again..."
