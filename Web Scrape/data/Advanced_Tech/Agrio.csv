R Shackleford,3,2019-04-30,"Has potential, but anything I submit it returns no results. It says there is not enough information. Tomatoes aren't even on the list it offered. I give it 3 stars for the potential. At the moment it is useless to me. I'm just baffled that it doesn't know some of the basic garden plants. Or rather ""not enough information"". Even though it only asked for a photo, and what general species the plant is."
Levi Spears,5,2021-01-23,"Great app thats useful for growers to identify plant issues. Responses from the experts are fast and helpful. One suggestion is for the problem questionnaire to include more crop types to select inside or to let the user manually key in the plant species itself, as not every plant type is listed. Would totally recommend this app."
Alon Ovadiya,5,2020-09-19,Looks good. Excellent UI simple and easy to use. Graphics are appealing. Felt like as if the rating perhap don't reflect the amount of efforts put into making it work.
Sivakumar S,3,2022-03-17,Good. Responsive team.
senthilathiban Veeriah,5,2021-06-13,I have been using this for more than a month. I am on the Premier package. The team at Agrio are outstanding üëè. They have responded to each and every enquiry I send. They communicate very well seeking clarification if necessary and Sometimes photos to enable them to analyse the problem. The advice I have received is excellent. I normally do some research myself and have found their advice spot on. I am extremely pleased with Agrio and the team. I have recommend Agrio to friends and family
Joanne Zitko,1,2019-02-17,"All I want is an app where I upload the photo, type in the plant and get the disease. I don't want to be hit with a sales pitch before I even open the app for an upgrade. I needed to identify a tree. couldn't find trees. Had to install."
abdul ghaffar luni,5,2019-09-05,really its a great app. but few experts need to add in agrio team . speacially cotton pathalogist and entomologist. and kindly add weed expert . video should be downloaded when we had problem.only pics are not sufficient to diagnose problem .thanks .luni
Lior Koj,5,2020-09-18,"Brilliant app! I appreciate the expertise of the team, they devote allot of time to get to the bottom of things and help as much as they can. It is very much appreciated!"
Nagesh Rathi,5,2021-06-20,The community in this app is really great. I usually get answers to my questions within the day and diagnosis has been pretty accurate in my experience.
Shane LUY,4,2021-03-14,"Very quick answer. Even if the app didn't recognise the issue, the community of people have responded."
Wina Willis,5,2020-05-13,"So far so good , I manage a nursery and sometimes need to research thing I've not seen before . I did that and got answers I was looking for."
