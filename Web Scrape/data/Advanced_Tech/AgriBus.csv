Cody Schlickbernd,3,2018-05-10,"There is a bug that won't let you change implement width using imperial 
units. You have to set first and then switch to metric to make it change. 
The UI could use improvement. The tracking was awful but that's maybe more 
the phones fault"
Les Harbour,3,2017-12-01,Has promise but is severely lacking in instructions for use to get the best out of it... especially for saving fields and coverage logging to come back to the next day. A dozen YouTube videos on the obvious functions aren't enough and useless if you need to check how to do some function you find you need out on the job if you don't have internet in the field. Synchronizing data is no good without internet (very patchy where I am) so if you close the app or it crashes then you lose your data. This happens repeatedly and is very frustrating. More instructions please or else I will have to keep looking at competitors.
David Acheson,1,2017-06-28,App loads the first time then won't load after that
Bat-Erdene Jigj,4,2017-01-16,"AgriBus-Connect, Can't activate by email, can't sign up, is there is having any support forum or help instruction?  Fast respond, And after few hours software updated and problem solved!!!"
Brannon Stone,1,2016-09-05,"Junk Does not work, it's  junk"
Michael Williams,5,2016-06-22,Very good
Brenton Juett,4,2016-06-07,Good app Good app but more instructions are needed i.e what perameters need changing to get G-Mouse exturnal GPS antenna to work. Area is not accurate. I find when app says 0.66ha actual area covered is 1ha .thanks for the great app but hope to see more detailed instructions in future please.
Dan Schneider,3,2016-05-28,"US version Can't see where to change to English units!  MPH, feet, acres.   Also, no way to save data."
Mike Burnett,4,2016-05-21,Great app Would be great to be able to save data and A/B lines etc and to be able to share with other staff. Can the paid version do this?
Ben Davis,4,2016-05-04,V useful Great simple app to use when try to fertilise fields and spray without a exspesive guidance system
eric campbell,2,2016-02-16,Can't get it to function I'm from UK and can't get this to function on my phone (lg g3) with Android 5.0 or on my tablet nexus7. Is there a GPS antenna that's recommended and a micro usb adapter cable that can be got ect that might fix this problem.
James Miller,5,2016-03-10,Works great for broadcast planting and spraying Look forward to future development. Would love to see basic field mapping feature added to this app.
Abraham Bensend,2,2016-03-12,"Needs imperial units: acres, feet, mph Very promising, but lacks anything other than the metric system.  Fix this, and it will explode in popularity."
Jacques Coetser,4,2015-07-06,Is there a users manual to help setting it up ?
richard dangerfield,5,2015-06-04,AgriBus.Nav I couldn't believe how well this works and how much i use it in the tractor . Highly recommended.
Jacob Ferrero,4,2015-05-13,Will not open on Galaxy Note 10.1 4.4.2.  Thanks! It does work on my phone. Galaxy Note 4 version 4.4.4.  Very good app.
Peter Tullett,5,2015-04-27,Great
Allen Bond,3,2018-04-12,If it would allow me to use ft and inches and not metric I would use it.
