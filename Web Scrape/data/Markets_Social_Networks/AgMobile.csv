Keith Schrunk,4,2021-11-11,"On Google Pixel doesn't update the commodity prices if stays open it minimized in background. You have to close it and reopen to refresh prices. Also on Options screen the default has ""at the money"" options but prices are no where close to at the money. Have to select show all and scroll to get accurate information"

A Google user,3,2015-02-05,"Overall I really like the app. My problem is the forecast is not accurate...no I don't mean off by a few degrees. I mean for the last week it has for some reason been forecasting temperatures in the 100s  (F), when I live in VA, and similar ""weirdness."" It is either just ""off,"" or picking up a forecast from some other place. Current conditions seem to be right. Please get this fixed!!! Also, I would prefer to see the weather easier/quicker to access in the app. Thank you!"
Rita Stephens,1,2015-02-05,"Location service does not work on my phone My husband got this app for his iPhone and likes it, but I am unable to get it to recognize my location on my android phone.

Craig Dunker,5,2014-11-26,Nice app
Tyler Bottoms,5,2014-10-30,Having the ability to customize my watchlist with commodities and stocks is very nice. 2 clicks of a button on my phone and I see where I stand in all markets. I can quickly check out my weather and look at ag or national news to get my day started. If only it served me coffee it would do everything I need every morning.
Ron Killion,4,2014-11-04,Would like to see a help or glossary tab. For a newbie like me to help understand some of the terminology for example the basis why some prices have a minus number in red and some have green numbers I take as a plus. And what that means to the price. Also it doesn't bring up all the elevators in my area. Other than those things I feel the app is very informative and believe it will be very helpful in the future.
Jean Baker,5,2014-10-06,"Ag info all in one place Cash bids that auto search for locations closest to me work great and are a real time saver. All the market data and ag news you need, in one place."
