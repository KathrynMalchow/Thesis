heath brant,5,2022-02-02,Had some small issues at first and left a review here. Michael got with me immediately and helped me thru the process of tracking down the issue. After a day it all ended with me just needing to delete the app and install it again. Overall good app unfortunately nothing in my area yet. Hopefully as the app gains popularity there will be
Denise Bradley,4,2021-11-09,One thing I am finding that could be improved on is the notifications on who is posting resumes. Maybe add a setting feature that will allow you to get notifications for your local areas and not the whole world? I have been getting notified every time someone adds a resume in areas not even close to where I live.
Teri Glenn,1,2021-07-16,"I was really looking forward to this app, but have been very disappointed. I cannot open applications and there is no way of knowing if my messages thru this app have gone thru. I have reached out to support but they just give me the reasoning that they can't help due to privacy reasons....so have applicants or employers sign a waiver or release so you can help get the info from point a to point b."
Craig Sash,1,2021-12-10,"I get applicants and can't contact them, see qualifications or anything."
Steven Tucker,1,2021-11-22,This app only shows resumes of candidates not eligible to work
Tom Parker,2,2021-08-29,"The app is good in theory, but failed to produce any potential employee leads. Was also asked more than once to pay for the top of thd line subscription which i paid for when i posted my first ad."
Alex Gardner,4,2021-08-04,This app has potential. Its worth using in conjunction with other job searches. Pro-tip change your location in your profile to get jobs from your area or the area your looking for.
Terry Manderscheid,1,2019-10-01,"Kinda frustrating. When I get a notification saying there's a job that matches my skill set in my area , and when I go to see what the job is, is tells me there's no jobs in my area...."
jordan king,2,2021-11-07,Went to finish updating my profile and it had fully erased my profile. Wanted me to start over.
Carrie Landwehr-Otto,3,2021-02-04,I was confused about responses that I received from applicants. It was hard to find and keep track of the applicants.
Rosie wlf,1,2021-07-09,App requires Facebook to register even though it doesn't say it's affiliated with Zuckerberg. So it's a useless app for anyone who has dropped that platform as so many of us have.
Cody Pritchett,4,2021-01-23,Hi the app is telling me that my email and password is invalid any help would be great thanks

chris lucas,2,2021-05-25,"Nothing in my area... Closest is 300+ miles away, and I live in farm county..."
Rocco Epic Photography,1,2021-03-22,Absolutely pathetic only shows you jobs that all over 2000 miles away this is absolutely ridiculous and I think it is stupid as hell.
Jeremy Roth,1,2020-08-29,What a joke. This app will not accept my address for registration. I damn well where I live.
Brett Moravits,1,2020-09-29,Will not even let me into app. Says that farmhand app has stopped
