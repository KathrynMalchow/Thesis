Parth Tripathi,5,2022-02-19,"After trying many other application me and my farmer cluster shifted on Bighaat application and it has been a wonderful experience since then. Agronomy support provided by them is top notch. We have received good quality seeds, pesticides, fungicide on time on our door step at farms.

Explore World,2,2021-05-26,Worst follow up of order and inventory.. Half the products are not available even after a second wait although it shows it's available.Prices are very high comparing other sites. The team doesn't know what is available and what is not.No point ordering although everything else is attractive.If the situation was for one product it is understable but not for every second product.. Waste of money.. App ordering doesn't work with stock in hand (avaible)no notifications. Toll free number not working.

Subhashree Nayak,1,2021-10-26,I have been a Big Haat customer for over two years. Recently I have very bad experience with the delivery of items that I had ordered. In spite of repeated calls they are not very cooperative. My suggestion to fellow farmers to be cautious while ordering from them.
