Almin Helex,4,2022-01-11,"It has excellent information. Can sort by state and auction house to find something nearby as well as detailed information on average weights and prices of heifers, steers and bulls (all I care about). Only reason a star is lost is because there is not a paid, ad-free version of the app. Other than that it is very helpful for min maxing profits and a good app for you modern stockman."
Doug Knudson,1,2019-12-26,"Used this app for a long time and it has been very useful, but now with 'in you face' annoying ads, I'm done. There are lots of alternate sources of this info."
Darrell Evans,1,2020-09-22,"Its very hard to let you know what I think about your app when It won't even let me download it at all , I'm looking at buying 400 to 500 head of young cattle and I can't even look to see anything at all . I'd bet if anyone of your Rancher's knew that they lost out on a sell of that many Head of Cattle ,They would be very up set over this app ,!!!"

Tammy Foster,5,2016-02-22,Great site
Tom Cone,2,2015-03-17,Great idea But the report in my area appears to be a .pdf. I am unable to zoom in and the print is too small to read even with glasses. I would buy the app if it worked.
Byron Ross,2,2015-08-19,"Minnesota has cattle Nothing on Minnesota, there is a market here that is reported I'm sure, until it is added it is the best I can do for a rating"
Jared Rice,2,2015-06-20,Has potential but. It only has 21 out of 50 states. Why? And a lot of in state markets missing.
Christopher Mayhew,5,2015-04-06,Right on the money This app follows the markets I watch very closely and helps us know what we can expect when going to market.

Dawn Dye,3,2014-10-09,Doesn't work so well Will not let me choose a category after I choose a location so I cant go any farther . It is pretty much useless at this point.
Ben Sherry,3,2014-03-18,Looks good I am starting a beef herd and this helped a lot the only thing is Wisconsin isn't on the app. This isn't a big deal because I live near Iowa but I wish you could fix that.
Cameron Lee,4,2014-04-12,Good app I'm from mn would love to see mn on here as an option to choose from but it's great to see what the cattle prices are doing out there

Nick Straw,2,2014-09-12,Couldn't get it to load reports and there's no Minnesota to select so I had to select a market 3 hours away. I had high hopes for this but it fell short.
Jeff Greenlee,4,2016-09-19,"Nice app One the HTC One M9, I can not just select one report from a state. It is all or none. Used to work before the update."
Dylan Couillard,1,2016-01-04,Bullshit It doesn't have all the states.
Mike Hermanson,1,2014-12-15,No coverage Doesn't cover Minnesota or Holstein cattle
A Google user,1,2017-05-04,No upper mid-west states on the  report
