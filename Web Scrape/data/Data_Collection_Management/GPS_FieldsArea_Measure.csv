Sam Foote,5,2022-03-07,"Excellent app for accurate measurements, very easy to pin exactly where you want to measure. I use the manual measuring tool a lot for measuring field boundaries and general yard measuring for building jobs etc. The GPS measuring tool isn't that great but I put that down to my phone's GPS quality rather than the app. Ads aren't too intrusive either."
Amir Hazrati,5,2022-02-21,"It's so useful app for me as a farmer. I was using it in my old phone and it did a great job, but the thing is my new phone doesn't allow this app to use GPS when the screen is off. This is a problem for me because the farmland is big and takes a good time to have a circle around it. Also while jogging I can't put it in my pocket with the screen still turned on."
Muhammad Maaz Ullah Khan Sumbal,5,2022-03-16,A Very Good Experience. Excellent app to track your movement and measure the distances covered. I needed to measure the area of my agricultural land and it helped me alright.
Diwansingh Bhati,5,2022-03-04,if you looking for an app that calculate distance and meassurs area accurate then you have to try this app. it helps properly for field and area measurements. but the price for premium upgrade is high. app management have to reduce price. i hope they consider that point.
Steve Mccullough,5,2022-03-22,"It allows you to measure a site, without having to physically go to a site, so I can give estimates to potential customers. Very convenient and time saving."
safdar mohammadi,5,2022-02-05,"It's one of the best applications for measure the area, distance and find the point, it's very useful and easy to work,but I don't know that, can I send the saved file to another computer or application for print the map? thank you"
Ken Carlson,3,2022-01-08,"This looks useful, but I have a few questions. 1. Is it possible to outline several areas on a single map, and print them all on the same map? Can the Pro version do this? 2. On Google Play, the Pro version is listed for $16.99, but in-app there is an option to upgrade to ""premium"" for $54.99 per year. Why the big discrepancy? What is the difference? 3. Is there an English website? There is a website link on Google Play, but it is not in English."
YOGENDRA VIKASH RAM,5,2022-03-13,This is the best ever app I have been using since 2018 to measure farms area and also used for navigation while fishing.Very simple and easy to use and works on any android device.No hesitation to rate 5 stars and recommended my friends to download and use and thumbs up frm them.
Brad West,1,2022-03-21,Do not waste your time or money you can get countless others for free that are exactly the same . no reason to be paying it's been a year now since I 1st downloaded this and I somehow accidentally paid the $55 for a full year subscription which I tried to cancel immediately and upon doing so really realized how much Of scam artist I was working with here they they refused to refund my money . It was not a half of a year later that is a lie and he knows it. I'll copy the emails and post here
Jeremy Cullen,3,2021-12-18,This is a great app I use it everyday. I would give it a 5 if they would update the map. My farm has changed so much in the last 3 years with new races and hedges being ripped out but with no change to the map it makes it difficult
Muhammad Asghar,5,2022-03-14,Very good app. It is best alternative of Costly GPS meter. But GPS meter is always best and accurate
Jacques Van Der Merwe,5,2021-12-20,"I love this app. You can stick to its simple settings or options or go into more skilled tweaking if the nodes, which ever suits you. It gives quick results."
Mzeewakazi,5,2022-03-11,"excellent app, only thing I would kindly ask is not to get into politics as your icon shows, very sad for all who are suffering from both sides"
Charles Powell,5,2022-03-14,Very nice and easy to use. Love being able to.move pins and fine tune.
Jason Rich,4,2022-03-27,"Seems to be a really good app, really accurate and easy to use. Kudos devs!!"
Emma Lambie,5,2022-03-15,"Great app, awesome to work out lengths and area, accurate to about 1m on lengths"
Andreas Hatz,1,2019-07-14,"Downloaded this app to measure areas in a field. Got nothing out of it. All it did was show my position on the map, without recording any distances, areas or position points. No clear way of achieving either of these objectives. Not very intuitive user interface. So got nothing out of it except a few ads. Waste of my time. Definitely not going to take a chance with a paid version in case it is just as useless."
Edgar Quintana,5,2021-05-29,"Very accurate, easy to use, paid version eliminates ads and ads bonus features. I've accuracy check by measuring area with measuring wheel, the results are phenomenal spite three meter difference. I don't want to sound like a cookie cutter comment but highly recommended. I've already mentioned accuracy at the beginning. In my opinion it deserves two mentions. Very happy with app, I use it for material applied and billing on my line of work. It saves me time. Thank you !"
Institutional Division,5,2020-01-10,"This app is better. It could be the best if you could add feature like AUTO MEASURE the distance or the length of the road from one place to another by just pinning the starting point and end point. You know it is very tiresome and annoying to measure point by point the very long and much winding road. And along with the road-length measurement, also add the straight-line measurement---not by the road. Thanks."
Michael Bryant,4,2019-04-22,instructions would be helpful. but not real hard to trial and error learn. would like to have more than 1 group of properties to group looks like that is available in the premium package but what is free gives me the field acreage which is what I need. updated mapping would be helpful. mapping is at least 5 years old. I know because I have a building that is not shown.
Graham Penner,3,2020-03-11,"This app has been handy for establishing my farm's property markers, field edges and of course determining the size of my fields. Would love to be able to use Ontario GIS satellite imaging with it as it has the best image quality for my property. Unfortunately, it is really easy to stop tracking during a mapping session with the start/stop button at the very edge of the screen."
Martin Malcomson,5,2018-11-08,"Pretty accurate measurements and features for a free app. I use it for outdoor activities all the time now. Great for airsoft, our just showing friends where tails are and how long of a walk. Great app. I was asked to rate when I first opened the app, before I could even see the screen layout, I gave 2 stars after a few days of use easy 5 Stars and probably be upgrading to pro version. Excellent job developers!"
dontnubblemebro,5,2018-12-11,"I've been using this app for quite a long time, for sowing and spray rate applications, plus fencing quotes and such. While I've never used the more advanced features, the basic distance and area measurement is fantastic. Most of the people I've done work for and their neighbours are using it, I've received quite a few cases of beer for it!"
Ramu Sangem,4,2021-08-03,"Very useful app. Distance measurement is accurate (deviation of about 2-3 ft). GPS measurement fluctuates but we can measure using ""add point"" without using ""start measuring"" . Only issue I have faced is that when we calculate a closed area, we are shown only the total perimeter and area but the lengths of the sides are not shown. Would appreciate if someone can help me if this app supports this side length feature too."
Eth Ratha,4,2022-03-26,Good feature and easy to use.
Kris Andrues,2,2019-12-26,"I paid extra for an upgraded version, so I could save my walks. However, in order to save measurements I would have to buy a monthly subscription - I THOUGHT I was getting a version that would do just that when I paid the extra amount. It also has to stay on - I could not switch to a different screen like to listen to music when I'm walking. This app is not useful to me"
Jim Long,4,2019-10-22,"I am an electrical engineer with some programming experience. This app is a great use off cell phone features, specifically the GPS. I am using it to calculate area of our small pastures to estimate the amount of winter rye seed needed. On our first pasture the mapping showed a couple of spurs in the outline that I did not walk. This could be the app or possibly my cell phone GPS system. Other than that it is quite handy."
Oscar Maroo,5,2022-03-17,"The best app ever on area measurements estimations, it has really come in handy."
Thomas calil,5,2022-01-12,So far it's working very well. I'd like to purchase full version (not subscription) and add an external GPS antenna. Which model works?
Robert Biascan,5,2022-03-01,"Amazing ,wonderful and what an idea to creat this kind of apps."
george spiciarich,1,2020-11-14,"Terrible. Dont waste your time. I tested against measured distances. It wasn't even close. The app had difficulty in accurately locating the start point under clear sky conditions (ie no overhead trees, clear sky day) I walked a 90 ft measured line multiple times with the app. Results were from 68 to 126 ft. Couldnt reproduce the same measurement even once. The app occasionally cant accurately locate at the beginning of the measure. Off by miles in some cases. Google maps would find me"
Rick McKeegan,4,2018-12-08,"Just to try this app...I was paving asphalt at an airport so took shots along the perimeter of my work. Our survey provides me with total square footage of my area for payment. When I compared my shots using GPS with survey's, we were only about 500 square feet different from 38,800 sq ft placement. Fantastic! Now...my shots were taken on a clear day so signal response was at it's highest. Love this app!"
Muhammad Khalid Siddique,2,2021-11-18,It has no option to save measurements...it's major issue...ðŸ‘Ž There is no way to save from uninstalling.... Can I save my data in this application if it is has been deleted from cell phone.???
Rameez Raja,4,2021-11-12,Not accurate. Accuracy 93%.. Otherwise very good and also some important unit in area measurement missing like square feet etc
Fowad Ahmed Khan.,1,2022-01-22,When i imported kml of size 2 mb containing measurements .. app can't handle and crashes whenever i start app . What is this .. even I've brought premium. It sucks
makinawdvrs,4,2021-12-16,Easy to use and accurate. Makes figuring out areas and acres very easy and quick.
Rajy Raja,5,2022-02-16,Very useful for measuring distance and area
Just a dude passing by,1,2022-03-05,"Downloaded one new phone, still doesn't work? I can send you a screen shot. STILL SUCKS, I put in an address in Texas and it takes me to Russia or newfoundland....??? Have reinstalled and un-installed so many times...doesn't ever work!! Sucks now, doesnt locate on first-third try, than error codes pop up. Terrible, used to love this app. Need phone running android 9.0"
Subodh K,4,2021-11-25,"This application needs to be accurate and better, improve and improve, The quality of pictures and graphics needs to be improved."
Florida 4Runner,1,2019-11-13,"Location by address not working anymore, I had this app for a full year using it almost daily,I could just type in a address and it would jump to the correct location ,now after renewing my subscription It can't find a single address and jumps to irrelevant out of state locations, after months of requesting help from IT department no response has been received,it was great but now it's worthless for what you pay for unless they can fix this issue it's not worth the money,one star for no response"
sevenfoot monkey,5,2022-02-21,"Simple, basic, useful, works."
Rodney Flanegan,1,2022-02-28,"I have used this app for year's and it worked perfectly. However ilost my phone and had to download it again. It measures areas/,distance well. But it won't save anything."
Santoso Wardoyo Ramelan,5,2022-03-09,easy to use. very helpful.
Zwanga Mbedzi,5,2022-03-08,Makes life on site simple and effective for big area measurements.
ayushya prakash,5,2021-12-27,If you are looking for an app which can calculate an area on map or tell you the distance on the map then this is the application you are looking for. Good app with nill advertisements.
Main Chow,4,2022-03-15,One of the best measuring applications I have ever used. Ease of use and accuracy are remarkable. If it add further magnification option it would be fantastic.
Jeremy McCullough,4,2020-02-09,"I've been using this app for a couple years and love it. About as accurate as you can expect from an app. The only thing i would recommend is make a feature that allows you to measure a square or cirle then add a house, barn or grain bin to those measured dimensions. You could in scale add additions to your properties to have an easy visual of how it would lay out before you begin building."
Jared Russouw,3,2018-11-18,"I really like the idea and the look of the app. Dissapointing that basic functions such as differant colors for the markers and areas are only available to premium users. I would upgrade to premium, but the cost of R42 just doesn't warrant it."
Erickson Targa,5,2022-03-12,Absolutely free and amazing app.
oussama yami,4,2022-03-11,"Very good app, so usefull for professional"
suresh Baswaraj,5,2022-03-27,If you app super explain the situation and great Idea for approval and app
Mahiraj Rathore,5,2022-03-27,Very easy to use n useful app
Tupeni Gonelevu,5,2022-03-21,It's helpful and accurate
Justin harry,5,2022-03-11,Very handy and easy yo use...
Dirk Rodenburg,5,2022-03-15,So easy to use! Great app
David Lintz,5,2020-02-24,"I was asked to rate this app shortly after I downloaded it. I gave it one star because there were no instructions with it and I couldn't get it to work. After playing with it for awhile I figured out how to use it and now I love it. I'm impressed with the results. It's a great tool to easily get an estimate of dimensions and areas, but you still need to do physical measurements if accuracy is required."
Thomas Kemp,1,2020-12-31,"This app was about 40 times off of an area measurement. It's lacking some key features like showing boundaries, the GPS was showing I was 4 miles from my official location (Google maps showed my location just fine) and while the perimeter measure seemed accurate, the acreage measurement was saying 80 acres instead of 2 acres. Also, if you like ads of green alien women with big bosoms, you might be interested in this app because it was NOTHING BUT ADS EVERY TIME YOU TRIED TO DO ANYTHING."
PASANG,5,2021-02-15,"I have been using this app since 2018 and it's very easy to use. When there is good internet coverage, the results are 99% accurate when compared with cadastral survey. I would like to suggest the developers to add features for taking photos like the SW map and also feature for traking to predetermined points."
Annie C,5,2019-07-02,I found this app easy to use. I calibrated it on a site map and found it very accurate. I picked a lot of points to map out the boundary of my fields alternating between satellite and road map outlines. Thanks for this. It served my purpose well.
CE Brown,5,2019-04-05,"This application really cleared up my lot line issue. I had to experiment on the first try, but once i got the hang of it, I was good to go! ........and just to let folks know NJ rural lot lines are hard to follow especially when the lots are odd shapes. Nothing is cut and dry in South Jersey."
b s,5,2020-03-30,"Great app. Used to to roughly map out the 1.5 acres in the woods where we plan on building. Very easy to use. Just press start measuring and walk. Thats it. It tells you the length, acreage and draws a line on the satellite map with the terrain."
Jeff Mauldin,1,2019-04-19,"I simply wanted an app to find survey pins, this was totally useless for that, of course it has no real instructions or directions so for all I know this app wasn't for surveying. hell, for all I could get out of it it may be a cooking app, but today useless to find survey pins. I did however get a good look at my property, sadly it us 4 years old because the change a from that time aren't on your map. update: I downloaded another app and their's worked fine, so be glad there is no zero rating."
phani kumar,4,2019-03-05,"in this app not available multiple enters coordinates (latitude, longitude), only one time recording coordinates. for accurate area drawing on map. I want to calculate area to our agriculture land. if I take multiple positions using latitude and longitude accurately. then I enters this Location points in application and add these points then I wanted to prepare the documents."
Phil Revis,5,2020-06-22,"Tutorial needs to be much more in depth. Using it as I went. You would think it would be a simple start here drop pin, got to point B, drop pin, go to point C, etc. Then measure, all I got was a grey dot at point A, then some funky longitude and latitude at B, and nothing at C, or D, then it gave me some straight line measurement. UPDATE TO LAST REVIEW: THEIR IMPROVEMENTS AND MY TAKING A LITTLE MORE TIME TO WORK WITH THE APP MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE! WOULD NOW HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!"
Clayton Wolfenden-Fisher,4,2020-03-19,"Love the experience on Android. Mapping manually can be very glitchy on iOS. Subscriptions are far too pricey for me, but the free version does a lot. If there was a buy for medium around $60 AU per annum. I'd be in."
Thomas Rodrigue,5,2019-05-29,Just have the free version. Layed out my property lines on the satellite view using the distance function with my official recorded survey numbers. Wow. I'd like to talk to the surveyors back then. My lot is not square. The front is 95.45ft across and the back is 86.25 across. 90' front and 90' rear would have been more logical. Now it looks like I'm mowing 5 feet into my neighbors yard. We are friends. Had a good laugh. Good app. Thks.
Kwashirai Karima,2,2019-07-20,"It was the perfect app for me until I woke up and found that all the points, areas and distances i had spent months measuring and saving are gone! Not sure what went wrong or if that data can be retrieved??"
Colin Elrick,5,2021-03-28,"Saved me thousands. So, so handy during sowing and harvest operations. You can figure out hectares in a few clicks and know where you are and what you need. Wonderful app. Sometimes modern technology does reduce stress and workload! :-)"
Gabriel Marinho,4,2021-06-30,"Really good, helped a lot to plan my co struction on the land. not sure how to get elevation of points. I would like to export a vector to other programs, and make level curves. I would pay for these functionalities."
Chimera Comstock,1,2020-04-27,App keeps crashing when opening. This is my third time to have to reinstall the app this week to be able to use it and I lose all my saved measurements when that happens. Worked great for 6months but now won't open and of it does it crashes right away. I'm using it on a Note 10.
Tamara Follett,5,2019-04-24,"Wow! I have downloaded a dozen of these apps over the years and this one is by far the best! Very powerful, intuitive, minimal ads! I used it to obtain area and measurements for a planned dog yard. Highly Recommended."
John Zikas,5,2018-10-13,"Very useful if you need to get a very accurate measurement of an area in the go! I'm in real estate business and this has really helped and I've tested the measurements with real values of some plots of land, the app is less than 3% off!"
Ryan Thomas,3,2021-09-10,It is a well thought out app and im certain it could have its uses. But it is not accurate. I measured a 2km course to practice for army fitness and wondered why i was so slow. Turns out iv been doing closer to 3km! Thats quite a wide margin of error
S Mitchell,1,2020-01-21,Customer service could improve. I have tried to get a response for the last 4 months with no reply. Liked the program very very much that there is a glitch I'm having trouble with so I guess I will have to stop my subscription and find another app.
Jason Judihardjo,1,2020-09-24,"Worthless app. Inaccurate, confusing displays. Dowload counts can be a deceiving factor. If app has nothing to do with accuracy deal with area viewer instead of area measure. Accuracy is important for measure. I am a user and the excuses you gave me is none of my concern, I am just reviewing and sharing my experience."
RAHUL S,5,2019-12-22,"I am using this app since 2017 and there is no problem at all. Till now i measure lots of plots. I would like suggest that, after taking area measuremen please mention there name for points which we have taken like point A, Point B, Point C likewise and the should be a given distance between two such points, and if possible to creat a page where all this info diaplay. Thanks a lot for ur great app..."
TWH Ranch,2,2021-03-14,"Not very accurate, may be OK if your looking for a very rough estimate. Tryed the app on a known level plot of land with corners already marked and official per country records. The result of sum area was off by almost an acre. Google Earth is a lot more accurate, but decided this app a try with high hopes all for not."
stevie wonder,5,2021-04-04,Great. Would be nice if when doing area the distance also shows up at the same time. I found I had to save one distance each time than use the area to figure it out cause I'm bad at this stuff. Great app. 4.8 stars so I round it to 5!!
James Dorey,1,2019-06-18,"I like the idea, but measurements are at best questionable. I reckon they're out by a factor of at least ten based on my preliminary estimates (which are based on Newton's Method). On the other hand, I have my doubts about GPS accuracy here in Tasmania generally. A timely response from the developers to this criticism suggests choosing ""high accuracy"" setting on my device. I shouldn't need to spell out that if I am measuring something, I would have done so (and did) in the first place."
Joni Vasbinder,5,2021-07-10,Best app. We use this a lot for digging out square feet in whatever fields we want to plant our spray. Measuring distance to put new fences in. So much easier than walking out or even riding it with a measuring device in theTexas heat. Measurements have been accurate.
