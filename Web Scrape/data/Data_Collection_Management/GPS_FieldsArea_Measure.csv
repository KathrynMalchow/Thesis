Sam Foote,5,2022-03-07,"Excellent app for accurate measurements, very easy to pin exactly where you want to measure. I use the manual measuring tool a lot for measuring field boundaries and general yard measuring for building jobs etc. The GPS measuring tool isn't that great but I put that down to my phone's GPS quality rather than the app. Ads aren't too intrusive either."
Amir Hazrati,5,2022-02-21,"It's so useful app for me as a farmer. I was using it in my old phone and it did a great job, but the thing is my new phone doesn't allow this app to use GPS when the screen is off. This is a problem for me because the farmland is big and takes a good time to have a circle around it. Also while jogging I can't put it in my pocket with the screen still turned on."
Muhammad Maaz Ullah Khan Sumbal,5,2022-03-16,A Very Good Experience. Excellent app to track your movement and measure the distances covered. I needed to measure the area of my agricultural land and it helped me alright.
Diwansingh Bhati,5,2022-03-04,if you looking for an app that calculate distance and meassurs area accurate then you have to try this app. it helps properly for field and area measurements. but the price for premium upgrade is high. app management have to reduce price. i hope they consider that point.
Steve Mccullough,5,2022-03-22,"It allows you to measure a site, without having to physically go to a site, so I can give estimates to potential customers. Very convenient and time saving."
safdar mohammadi,5,2022-02-05,"It's one of the best applications for measure the area, distance and find the point, it's very useful and easy to work,but I don't know that, can I send the saved file to another computer or application for print the map? thank you"
Ken Carlson,3,2022-01-08,"This looks useful, but I have a few questions. 1. Is it possible to outline several areas on a single map, and print them all on the same map? Can the Pro version do this? 2. On Google Play, the Pro version is listed for $16.99, but in-app there is an option to upgrade to ""premium"" for $54.99 per year. Why the big discrepancy? What is the difference? 3. Is there an English website? There is a website link on Google Play, but it is not in English."
YOGENDRA VIKASH RAM,5,2022-03-13,This is the best ever app I have been using since 2018 to measure farms area and also used for navigation while fishing.Very simple and easy to use and works on any android device.No hesitation to rate 5 stars and recommended my friends to download and use and thumbs up frm them.
Brad West,1,2022-03-21,Do not waste your time or money you can get countless others for free that are exactly the same . no reason to be paying it's been a year now since I 1st downloaded this and I somehow accidentally paid the $55 for a full year subscription which I tried to cancel immediately and upon doing so really realized how much Of scam artist I was working with here they they refused to refund my money . It was not a half of a year later that is a lie and he knows it. I'll copy the emails and post here
Jeremy Cullen,3,2021-12-18,This is a great app I use it everyday. I would give it a 5 if they would update the map. My farm has changed so much in the last 3 years with new races and hedges being ripped out but with no change to the map it makes it difficult
Muhammad Asghar,5,2022-03-14,Very good app. It is best alternative of Costly GPS meter. But GPS meter is always best and accurate
Jacques Van Der Merwe,5,2021-12-20,"I love this app. You can stick to its simple settings or options or go into more skilled tweaking if the nodes, which ever suits you. It gives quick results."
Mzeewakazi,5,2022-03-11,"excellent app, only thing I would kindly ask is not to get into politics as your icon shows, very sad for all who are suffering from both sides"
Charles Powell,5,2022-03-14,Very nice and easy to use. Love being able to.move pins and fine tune.
Emma Lambie,5,2022-03-15,"Great app, awesome to work out lengths and area, accurate to about 1m on lengths"
Andreas Hatz,1,2019-07-14,"Downloaded this app to measure areas in a field. Got nothing out of it. All it did was show my position on the map, without recording any distances, areas or position points. No clear way of achieving either of these objectives. Not very intuitive user interface. So got nothing out of it except a few ads. Waste of my time. Definitely not going to take a chance with a paid version in case it is just as useless."
Edgar Quintana,5,2021-05-29,"Very accurate, easy to use, paid version eliminates ads and ads bonus features. I've accuracy check by measuring area with measuring wheel, the results are phenomenal spite three meter difference. I don't want to sound like a cookie cutter comment but highly recommended. I've already mentioned accuracy at the beginning. In my opinion it deserves two mentions. Very happy with app, I use it for material applied and billing on my line of work. It saves me time. Thank you !"
Institutional Division,5,2020-01-10,"This app is better. It could be the best if you could add feature like AUTO MEASURE the distance or the length of the road from one place to another by just pinning the starting point and end point. You know it is very tiresome and annoying to measure point by point the very long and much winding road. And along with the road-length measurement, also add the straight-line measurement---not by the road. Thanks."
Michael Bryant,4,2019-04-22,instructions would be helpful. but not real hard to trial and error learn. would like to have more than 1 group of properties to group looks like that is available in the premium package but what is free gives me the field acreage which is what I need. updated mapping would be helpful. mapping is at least 5 years old. I know because I have a building that is not shown.
Graham Penner,3,2020-03-11,"This app has been handy for establishing my farm's property markers, field edges and of course determining the size of my fields. Would love to be able to use Ontario GIS satellite imaging with it as it has the best image quality for my property. Unfortunately, it is really easy to stop tracking during a mapping session with the start/stop button at the very edge of the screen."
Martin Malcomson,5,2018-11-08,"Pretty accurate measurements and features for a free app. I use it for outdoor activities all the time now. Great for airsoft, our just showing friends where tails are and how long of a walk. Great app. I was asked to rate when I first opened the app, before I could even see the screen layout, I gave 2 stars after a few days of use easy 5 Stars and probably be upgrading to pro version. Excellent job developers!"
dontnubblemebro,5,2018-12-11,"I've been using this app for quite a long time, for sowing and spray rate applications, plus fencing quotes and such. While I've never used the more advanced features, the basic distance and area measurement is fantastic. Most of the people I've done work for and their neighbours are using it, I've received quite a few cases of beer for it!"
Ramu Sangem,4,2021-08-03,"Very useful app. Distance measurement is accurate (deviation of about 2-3 ft). GPS measurement fluctuates but we can measure using ""add point"" without using ""start measuring"" . Only issue I have faced is that when we calculate a closed area, we are shown only the total perimeter and area but the lengths of the sides are not shown. Would appreciate if someone can help me if this app supports this side length feature too."
Jim Long,4,2019-10-22,"I am an electrical engineer with some programming experience. This app is a great use off cell phone features, specifically the GPS. I am using it to calculate area of our small pastures to estimate the amount of winter rye seed needed. On our first pasture the mapping showed a couple of spurs in the outline that I did not walk. This could be the app or possibly my cell phone GPS system. Other than that it is quite handy."
Kris Andrues,2,2019-12-26,"I paid extra for an upgraded version, so I could save my walks. However, in order to save measurements I would have to buy a monthly subscription - I THOUGHT I was getting a version that would do just that when I paid the extra amount. It also has to stay on - I could not switch to a different screen like to listen to music when I'm walking. This app is not useful to me"
Oscar Maroo,5,2022-03-17,"The best app ever on area measurements estimations, it has really come in handy."
Thomas calil,5,2022-01-12,So far it's working very well. I'd like to purchase full version (not subscription) and add an external GPS antenna. Which model works?
Robert Biascan,5,2022-03-01,"Amazing ,wonderful and what an idea to creat this kind of apps."
george spiciarich,1,2020-11-14,"Terrible. Dont waste your time. I tested against measured distances. It wasn't even close. The app had difficulty in accurately locating the start point under clear sky conditions (ie no overhead trees, clear sky day) I walked a 90 ft measured line multiple times with the app. Results were from 68 to 126 ft. Couldnt reproduce the same measurement even once. The app occasionally cant accurately locate at the beginning of the measure. Off by miles in some cases. Google maps would find me"
Rick McKeegan,4,2018-12-08,"Just to try this app...I was paving asphalt at an airport so took shots along the perimeter of my work. Our survey provides me with total square footage of my area for payment. When I compared my shots using GPS with survey's, we were only about 500 square feet different from 38,800 sq ft placement. Fantastic! Now...my shots were taken on a clear day so signal response was at it's highest. Love this app!"
Muhammad Khalid Siddique,2,2021-11-18,It has no option to save measurements...it's major issue...ðŸ‘Ž There is no way to save from uninstalling.... Can I save my data in this application if it is has been deleted from cell phone.???
Rameez Raja,4,2021-11-12,Not accurate. Accuracy 93%.. Otherwise very good and also some important unit in area measurement missing like square feet etc
Fowad Ahmed Khan.,1,2022-01-22,When i imported kml of size 2 mb containing measurements .. app can't handle and crashes whenever i start app . What is this .. even I've brought premium. It sucks
makinawdvrs,4,2021-12-16,Easy to use and accurate. Makes figuring out areas and acres very easy and quick.
Rajy Raja,5,2022-02-16,Very useful for measuring distance and area
Just a dude passing by,1,2022-03-05,"Downloaded one new phone, still doesn't work? I can send you a screen shot. STILL SUCKS, I put in an address in Texas and it takes me to Russia or newfoundland....??? Have reinstalled and un-installed so many times...doesn't ever work!! Sucks now, doesnt locate on first-third try, than error codes pop up. Terrible, used to love this app. Need phone running android 9.0"
ayushya prakash,5,2021-12-27,If you are looking for an app which can calculate an area on map or tell you the distance on the map then this is the application you are looking for. Good app with nill advertisements.
Subodh K,4,2021-11-25,"This application needs to be accurate and better, improve and improve, The quality of pictures and graphics needs to be improved."
Florida 4Runner,1,2019-11-13,"Location by address not working anymore, I had this app for a full year using it almost daily,I could just type in a address and it would jump to the correct location ,now after renewing my subscription It can't find a single address and jumps to irrelevant out of state locations, after months of requesting help from IT department no response has been received,it was great but now it's worthless for what you pay for unless they can fix this issue it's not worth the money,one star for no response"
sevenfoot monkey,5,2022-02-21,"Simple, basic, useful, works."
