Farmer Aj,5,2022-02-14,"Fantastic, I downloaded this app as i thought it would be a great way to keep track of jobs and fields. The whole team has access to the data and its really improved our communication and teamwork skills as we all know what needs to be done. We always have a plan and we are always adapting to changes in weather and such and this tool is just Fantastic for keeping up to date with everything. EVEN THE COWS HAVE A ROTATION PLAN HAHA! Could not recommend anything other than this app! Defo worth it!"
Michael Deitering,5,2022-02-18,This app is perfect for a diversified farm. The free version is full of useful record keeping. The real life overhead view of the farm adds a level of tangibility which makes laying out tasks easy to manage. The facto that it can be shared among other people and provide chat is especially useful!
Craig Willment,4,2022-02-15,"I find the app very useful,especially the field mapping and as a record keeping platform for what has been done in each field and when it's done. Customer service and help has also been very good."
Oliver Nash,5,2022-02-28,"Really great app, I have been with them from the start and they keep on adding great features. Great communication if you have any questions to."
Mark Batt,5,2022-03-11,Used the service for a long time now. Ever request at additional services has slowly been filled to a point its my go-to for recording chemical inputs to for my farm. Ali and Camilla are both brilliant and quick to respond to any requests or questions
David Harel,5,2022-03-03,Easy to use and helpful management tool. Very friendly and helpful team that provide great support.
Jon Clatworthy,4,2022-02-09,Looks really useful. Anyway of integrating a field margin calculator that will create any width of width of field adjacent to boundaries or around features? It would be really useful to calculate areas not to apply products to very quickly and also help calculate margin areas
Tim Black,5,2022-02-16,Fantastic app to use find it very useful to record data for fert and spray application. The app is always being improved and the staff are keen to help
Monte Yost,5,2022-02-18,"I'm really pleased to find an app that will show my farms on a map that I can configure anyway I need to, so helpful. Totals my acreage, all right on my phone, 5 stars."
G Bryant,4,2022-02-20,This program has simplified record keeping for our field rotation. So easy to record and see the history of herd movement.
Marc,5,2022-02-11,"Slick design, easy to use. More features being added all the time and listening to users."
James Hill,5,2021-10-18,I'm managing 57 aquaculture ponds and even though this app isn't designed for aquaculture it's made keeping track of what is happening in each pond vastly easier. Very easy to use. They also have real people to chat with and answer questions regarding the app.
Mike Hoseason,5,2022-02-14,A great way of commuicating with our extended farming team. An awesome tool to record our development and progress. Much of our work involves the transitioning from traditional farming practices into regenerative agriculture and forests and Fieldmargin has been instrumental on this journey.
Sam Cassells,3,2022-03-06,Easy to use. Info and stats at your fingertips. Simply brilliant
Charles Seamark,5,2022-02-20,"Great app with more features being added all the time, and developers willing to listen."
Peter Machir-Grant,5,2021-07-26,"If you've ever wanted a farm management app that works on all devices and covers every aspect of your farm, this is the app for you. It's intuitive, has lots of features, and just works. It works offline too. Allows you to stack those job lists up and take photos for reference later. Easy to get your staff on board and can even do print outs via your PC. 10/10 can't live without it now."
Paul Nehring,5,2021-06-17,"Super easy to setup farm maps and use features. Subfields were just added and are needed feature, though using them is not quite as clear as other features. Developers responded to issues quickly. I hope the grazing features keep developing to get closer to other apps. Yet, this is one of the few that cover both farm operations and grazing, as well as livestock management."
Nathan Nelson,4,2020-03-08,"Great app which has been happily picked up by our estate team including some more technophobic colleagues. Great interface. Friendly, responsive developers. Task planning is fun, overlaying uploaded maps is very useful. GPS functionality patchy (drawing areas by walking shows promise but doesn't work well) - this is more down to relying on phone GPS. Desktop satellite map images are out of date which is a frustration when planning work in the office. Really enjoyable, huge potential."
sandy McArthur,4,2020-10-08,"Yeh look it's a good app, but I think it would help if you updated your satellite images every year or so. The other day I was trying to look for my boundary fence in a bunch of scrub and forest, which we made last year and couldn't find it. This was because of the images which were taken a few years earlier, so i could not mark the boundary. Other than that a great app"
Leon Muller,5,2020-08-14,Been using the middle tier verion of fieldmargin for four months now. Seems to work well on both samsung phone and ipad. Really practical functions but still simple to use and edit info and to view paddock history. I haven't used gps for mapping or yield maps so can't comment on that. Looking forward to the livestock side of things to be implemented- will make app better again if able to have cropping and livestock records in one place. Staff have been helpful and promp with and issues I've had.
Lance Thony,5,2022-03-08,Very good would recommend as a good tool beside gps easy to setup and use
Lloyd Berry,4,2022-02-12,"Love Field Margin , have used it for 3 years and has been great for planning jobs. length of new fence or water system , we did 12 km of pipe and fittings knowing where all the joins would be , simplified trough and isolation taps.Fantastic for field spray jobs. Put in a job name, pick paddocks, put in water rate, each chem and rate from inputs list save and the job buy list in reporting. As paddocks are done they are ticked off till job completed. Reports‚úìlot devices/farm . Livestock‚úìoverall‚úì‚úì"
Nico Beukes,5,2022-02-15,Easy to use and team always ready to help .
Stamate Sorin,5,2021-11-29,Hi. Does the app allow me to upload existing maps with geometries? Like shapefile or gpx? It would be very helpfull since i already have the files and i will not waste time to draw all fields again. Thanks!
Richard Sands,3,2021-10-14,Would give it a run but not interested in having to create accounts etc. A stand alone package yes. Unfortunately couldn't even get started. Realise this isn't a fair appraisal but add this for others that are of same needs
Cyfoh Nike,3,2021-11-08,"I do enjoy this App, though I have problems with some of the functions like placing features like trees, and other stuff on the field..."
Laura Alvarez,5,2021-10-31,This app is helping us get a handle on a new ranch we purchased. I really like that we can add users and assign tasks.
WPR89,4,2018-12-05,I really like this app. Would give it 5 if the web version and mobile version used the same maps. If I create fields on the app (google maps) it does not fit precisely on the web version because web version uses bing. I would like to have the web version also use google maps so that created fields are not offset
Ashley Corry,5,2020-02-21,"Bloody brilliant for mapping out farms, hazards, water lines, creeks troughs and much more. Can be used for staff to complete and tick off jobs . To do lists and much more. Highly recommended from a long time farmer"
Francis Pik oloruntola,5,2021-10-14,This is a golden app for farmers in the recent time. I strongly recommend it to all categories of farmers.
Andrew Wise,5,2020-01-21,"Brilliant app but the GPS location is often wrong and very slow at updating and keeping up when moving, very annoying when trying to map out new drains."
MrBouz GOLF,4,2019-02-08,What a excellent idea for user friendly software on my farm. Already using a bit and doing a trial with one of my managers to see how we can incorporate this software into the farm. Having our weekly meeting today and think well try and do most of our planning on it to see how it goes. I have a few extra ideas that I would like to add on it aswell.
Teeper Rhyma,5,2020-09-27,Very user friendly and perfectly powerful. Definitely recommend this app. I only use it to keep track of field locations and field names but it's capabilities are FAR beyond that. Great job Devs!üëçüèº
Josiah Peter,5,2020-05-10,"It is an in-depth app with lots of uses. The people at field margin are really helpful, i had a question and they replied quickly."
South Wales Detectorist,5,2021-03-10,"Can I use this so to see farmers fields as I'm a metal detectorist, I have permission to detect on farms but not always 100% on all the land the farmer owns, I've downloaded the app but haven't registered yet until this question is answers, this app will be huge in the metal detecting world if we are able to just view who owns the land and what they have."
Bill Ashman,1,2020-02-29,Harrasment Nothing Short I uninstalled and unsubscribed from this app about 2 minutes after i installed it as it was rubbish. Despite an email from customer services assuring me that i would receive nothing further i had another email today. STOP IT.
Gavin Flowers,5,2020-01-17,An awesome app to use for both farms( total 110ha) that are used as pastures for hay making Recording comments notes are essential as we do 3 cuts a season so need to remind us often

Capeland Permaculture,4,2019-05-09,"Very good! Would just have liked some Permaculture add-ons like banana circles, swales, chicken tractor etc. But brilliant none-the-less."

Michael Egner,3,2020-10-19,Outdated map data undermines this otherwise very useful tool. Why not pull in from Google?
MOPOKE Hill,4,2020-01-21,Great app would be nice if it had more livestock options to complement mapping
3 Bar,4,2020-05-19,Nice app to use for notes and taking records. Can be improved for cattle farms
