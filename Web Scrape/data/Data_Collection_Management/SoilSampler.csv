Esmond Coen,5,2021-05-10,"Really nice app, but I have not found the place where I can insert my sample number - those ones generated is not very ""sample number friendly"". It would be great to add a sample number and have the app sequentially number further as one takes the soil samples in the field. The function to import or export soil sampling points seems not the available - it poses the question whether it is useful to have this great app but the the result of the app's functions stays with the app."
