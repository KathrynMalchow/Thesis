Forest Health,1,2019-07-09,"extremely inaccurate. you are much better off training your crews eye and estimating. this app simply doesn't work with coverage over 40%. it does work in low density, I guess, low density can be hard... I'm still looking for a replacement for GLAMA. why did it get pulled."

Spectrum Research Services,5,2018-03-19,This is a very helpful tool in assessment of field trials of the effects of various treatments on plant growth/canopy cover - takes out the guesswork of estimating plant row cover. Very useful
