Jake Petzold,1,2019-06-20,"Lower your price. Hundreds of comments saying it's a great app, but you set the price too high. We're willing to pay something, maybe like $5 a month for activities, rainfall, and heat units, and scale up from there with more features. You don't need to contact ME. Your company made an error in setting the prices too high The convenience of you aggregating free weather/soil data into a record keeping app is worth something....not $30. NDVI and some advanced marketing features may be worth 99/mo."
Craig DeVries,1,2020-01-23,"WAS a great app. free to use version had a great organized layout for tracking expenses and profits. all of the activities and business plan data is input and modified by the user, so basically a glorified spreadsheet design with better user interface. and NOW, after inputting and tracking my data for 3 years......... I am forced to pay or move my data elsewhere. STAY AWAY!!! zero warning or perks for users utilizing their services. terrible business move. Farm at Hand is much better!!!"
scott boedeker,2,2019-05-08,"when I first got the ap, it worked great. the rainfall totals were very close to the gauge totals. the previous ""update"" changed that, the totals were never even close. now, with the update on April 24th, it won't even open. when i try to open it hoping it is fixed, my phone locks up."
Janell K,1,2019-03-30,"I used to enjoy this free app for simple tracking of rain fall. Now, without warning, they have changed subscription levels for the people that have helped them build and design this app, and are charging at least $120 per year for access to data which was free a month ago. User beware, their greediness has taken over, and it's sure to only get worse. I will be finding another platform to track data on my own property"
kyle Lien,1,2019-05-23,"I found this app handy until I would have to pay $29/ month, so will be uninstalling. All i used was the rainfall tracking ( free information online) and logging activities (digital notepad or calendar would do). This app made it easy but Im not spending $29 a month or any amount for free information and a simple record of history."
Benjamin Dilworth,1,2019-06-14,"after last update, app won't open properly. It just keeps flashing across the screen of my Google pixel. I had to cancel my subscription because they jacked the price way up, and the free app is worthless. I will now be uninstalling this app and subscribing to FBN where you get so much more for your money."
Alex Reppucci,5,2019-11-23,Such a helpful and handy app. The company I work for uses it daily. We just upgraded to complete and having some app crashing issues but the support team is exceptional at helping with everything! Definitely recommend!
DellingerFarms LLC,5,2019-08-08,Our operation transitioned from multiple notebooks and spreadsheets to FarmLogs in 2017.  I love it.  Access to details any time.   The mobile app fits our hired help.  I prefer the web version.  We rely heavily on the activities.  Acreage reporting is a breeze now.  Product totals calculated from the rates and acres makes a good check against what we paid for. I'd suggest FL tweak the SprayLog report to meet Dicamba record requirements. That would be huge. Thanks for the excellent cust service!
Luke Berner,3,2019-02-23,"The app is good and easy to use, a little disappointed about the high cost of the new subscription coming at a time where funds are already short on the farm. Also need to add livestock"
Boyohboy,1,2020-10-27,"Too much money for what it offers. Missing a lot of chemicals in their application part, missing some very common fertilizers in our area, and have way more marketing garbage than a fellow ever needs. I wish I could find a app that would just let me track what I have done in each field."
Gregg Campbell,3,2018-11-09,"There is no cumulative function when tracking rainfall. Every new alert for rainfall changes all previous alerts to the most current alert, very awkward to track cumulative totals without writing them down, really?"
andrea king,3,2021-01-12,The free version is somewhat helpful but the cheapest paid plan being $65/month is ridiculous! It does not come close to being worth that much money for what you get.
A Google user,1,2019-03-14,"I use this app to track rainfall on the food plots we plant on our hunting property. Rainfall accuracy was only so-so compared to our rain gauge but at least the app showed you rainfall history. Now they're charging $29 per month for that - NFW! The free Lite version of this app is worthless, there is nothing in it. Goodbye FarmLogs!!!!"
Greg Outdoors,2,2019-05-07,"Understanding nothing is free, but 29.99/month!? I was grateful to find this app for tracking heat and rainfall actuals on our new homestead-to-be, given we haven't even established any type of yard or garden/beds, we were eager to make the most of this app for our micro-scale of future mini homestead, but again~ $360/yr. is far to rich for us/our minisucle needs. $30/yr for rainfall&heat historical data w/ current actuals, sold. Consider small scale homesteader version for annual sub option"
Jon Dorothy,1,2021-05-20,"Pointless, used to be good to track rain(ish never was very accurate) and manually enter field work. Now wants to charge an exhorbant amount of money with no options other than a lot of money or an extreme amount of money, no matter how many acres you are trying to manage (5 acres or 5000 acres) if it were to charge you something more understandable like $0.01 per acre per month for usable field data it would possibly be debatable but currently no absolutely worthless application. 0/5 ðŸŒŸ"
John Neidigh,4,2020-08-27,"Have a friend who swears by this app, but not what I need, and the LAST thing I'm gonna do is sign up for any ""free trial"" just to see more than how to draw a field! Not to mention there isn't even any home button to excape the freebie pitch page rabbit hole."
A Google user,5,2019-02-23,"Great, multifunctional app that pairs nicely with the FarmLogs web platform. Easy to use with a nice clean format. Before the update I've really utilized the ""Products"" function to keep track of our farm input inventory. FarmLogs team is also very responsive to feedback in order to make their app fit your operation. It's true that pricing for this has changed, but if you price other programs with similar features, FarmLogs is still the value option."
Farmer04,1,2019-02-25,"WAS a wonderful app it did everything i wanted too. I have 2 years of data, and now you have to pay to use the most simple things!!! REALLY?!?!?!?! This is ridiculous!!! STAY AWAY. greedy developers!!!"
Paul Reinarz,4,2020-06-17,The app is a bit finicky and stops now and again (hence 4 stars) but is a good companion to the web app. The support team was eager to help me out and persisted until my concerns had been meet.
Matt Welte,1,2019-02-07,99$ a month to manually record activities is ridiculous. Time to find something else that matches the cost/benefit better. Used to be a big fan of this but not for 99$ a month
Justin Harris,1,2019-04-14,Was a great app but its useless now. Started charging for the rainfall history feature without any notice. I used this app and quit recording it by hand and now all is lost. WILL NOT recommend this app anymore. sorry
Howard Stephenson,1,2019-02-17,This app was a nice app. Now they are just pure greedy. The owners just keep wanting more money for everything. This app is no longer worth having and I have stopped recommending it to my fellow farmers. The latest $$ grab is for rain and heat history.. I do not reccomend even trying this app.
Mike Jarrett,1,2019-04-25,"worked ok for a couple years. Now they want to charge an large sum for you to continue. Hence make comparing records from last year to this impossible. Probably a decent app for corn or beans, but I grow hops. It won't let me list my chemicals."
Bryan K,1,2021-05-08,Used to be a useful app to track activities and notes. Now you can't do much of anything without paying. Useless unless your a big farmer. Save your time and stay away
Bryan Robason,1,2019-06-18,"app once again has stopped working. go to open, and it locks down Samsung note 9. if your going to charge money for your app, atleast make sure its it's working."
Tim Faulk,2,2019-07-20,This app. WAS pretty cool...now you have to pay for everything but the weather/rain. I can get that information a dozen other places...I gurss its time to STOP CLUTTERING UP MY PHONE WITH IT!!!!!
Shawn Kisling,3,2019-04-18,Really liked the app at first. but lately their rainfall estimates are horrible and they made it so you need to subscribe in order to view rainfall charts.
Jennifer,1,2019-05-08,"This was an awesome app for rainfall and history of rainfall, but you all got greedy. so uninstalling. I can Google rainfall history for free."
Herman van den Berg,1,2019-04-26,Loved this app in the past but is useless now that we have to pay for it. I only used it to keep track of what we did and when we did it on fields and dont think it's worth it to pay $99 a month just for that.
justin andrews,2,2019-08-27,It was good until they went to charging $30 month. In my opinion this APP has priced itself out of the market.
Kenneth Lake,1,2020-05-15,"Free version of the app has a banner on every page, ""example data"", therefore useless."
Alan Schwartz,1,2020-11-11,Won't let me log in and log in screen is jacked up can't enter the letter I'm pushing it enters the one next to it
RC Wayt,3,2019-06-08,love the app but since the last update it wont open it just flashes black and white on my screen
Cole Harmon,1,2020-01-09,"Used to be a great app, but they got greedy. Now 70â„… of the app is locked behind a paywall."
Shawn Comes,1,2019-04-07,was a good app now sucks. your over charging for what you get history of rain and heat. and charging for soil types that public record
cindy hooker,2,2021-05-20,Used to be decent until changes and charginging for formally free parts of the app
Josh Tschappat,2,2019-06-02,app fails and when it does work it's not that accurate
Darwin's w Hofer,2,2019-05-24,this app was working excellent until last week..refused open
Matt Hennig,1,2020-03-05,Used to have wonderful rainfall and gdu charts suddenly for 2020 what I've enjoyed free for some years is $29 per month
Dustin Goehring,1,2019-05-17,used to be the best app on the market but apparently they got money hungry too
Anthony Philyaw,1,2018-10-18,The app is broken and cannot be opened.
Anthony Huhn,2,2019-07-26,once you update now they want you to pay for heat units and soil map!
Jason Kolar,1,2019-02-20,"used to be good as a free app, not worth the money they are asking"
A Google user,1,2019-03-21,When is the Rainfall Chart History coming back to the basic app?
Steve Easdon,1,2019-06-08,this app stopped working
Sharon Struble,1,2022-03-21,Free version is Worthless how much is the other version?
Marianne McCoy,1,2019-04-18,"started charging for rain history. um, no!"
Corey Gilbert,1,2019-05-12,was free now they charge you thanks thanks for nothing
Alexander Pineda,5,2021-01-06,The best app to my Farm.
Abe Martens,1,2020-01-08,Won't let me SIGN UP
David Gowin,4,2021-05-14,Nice ap
Collin Blatt,5,2019-08-04,"Could you add the ability to connect one's social media accounts to make sign in simpler? EDIT: Nice app, but I can't view soil types on fields for free anymore?"
Gordon Thomas,2,2019-06-27,"Gives me what i need at my finger tips. However, they are pricing themselves in their in app purchase too expensive."
Agri Dev,5,2019-08-14,great
James Ryen,1,2019-05-23,"This app is now a glorified rain guage. All the features we have found useful from the start you now have to pay for. Farm logs, if you are wanting to address my concerns, change it back to what it was last year!!!"
D H,1,2019-04-01,"I also thought it WAS a great tool to have, (5 star) until they started charging to use the app. Us farmers are trying to make ends meet with crop price at a 20+ year low, it would be nice not to be nickeled and dimed at every turn. My grandfather once told me ""when farmers make money, everyone makes money"""
Scott Holdeman,1,2019-02-15,absolute junk. after you get all your data put in they decide to do an update and now you have to pay for it. it's not worth paying for
Craig Smith,1,2019-02-21,GOODBYE
Kevin Feddersen,1,2019-04-21,"Just like everyone else has said, was a great app but now they want paid, very typical."
Justin ogan,5,2018-12-08,"This app is amazing! I have been using it for 3 years to keep records, track rainfall, and plan for future years. Would be lost without it. They update it frequently, and are very helpful. The new market feature is very nice. It is a great way to watch expenses and keep track of inventory! Awesome!"
Carol Grubel,3,2018-08-26,"Used to love this App. Since the last. Update and new update to the phone mobile phone system, the rainfall totals don't update. Some fields do while others don't. I'm sure it rained on those fields because of the close proximity."
Michelle Schafer,1,2018-09-06,This Ap is broken!!! It won't open!!!ðŸ˜¡
Bob Murray,5,2019-09-20,Great app!
A Google user,4,2018-07-12,worked great at first but now i cant even get the app to open
Patrick Scott,4,2018-06-12,"I have loved this app until recently it has started freezing up my phone. I 
uninstalled it to redo it and the haven't been able to reinstall. 
Reinstalled after waiting a day I and is working now."
Klapaucius,4,2018-02-21,"Excellent customer support. If you have an issue, just ask."
James Moran,1,2018-02-21,This app was great...not anymore. The update sucks...bye.
Douglas Lowell,5,2021-04-08,Very helpful
A Google user,5,2018-01-24,Great app but would really be great if I could drop points and name them in the soil maps when I'm pulling soil samples so I could come back to the same spot later.
Jason Alberts,1,2019-04-06,"well, bye!"
Luke Henneke,4,2017-12-13,Seems like a great app but would be nice if u could update the maps since they are from like 2010
Y V,2,2017-11-07,What happened to the map feature? I cannot check my fields using the map view anymore. It seems you have replaced it with activities instead. The only I can check my fields is through list view. The map feature was why I kept using farm logs. Please put it back.
Brad & Cassie Wans,4,2017-07-07,"While it's true this app is designed more for row crop farms, I use it on our hay ground to keep track of rainfall. We background 1000 dairy heifers, so we go through a lot of hay in a year! I start cutting middle of April and finish in September and October. Rainfall tracking is very important to manage fertilizer applications among other things. I can look at the app and see if a farm 20 miles away got any rain last night. That beats going to the feed store and listening to all the old timers as they guess how much they got. I can just open the app and show them how wrong they are. Worth it's weight in gold for that reason alone!"
A Google user,4,2017-06-07,I love this app. I'm not a very big farmer but I love growing crops. I would download this app again if It got deleted today.
Nick Hatcher,2,2017-04-10,"The new menus for seed selection is terrible, gave up on scrolling and put variety in the notes"
wes loegering,2,2017-03-23,Too much security for a simple rain report app.  Get over it and just provide me with yesterday's rain
KevinWomac,5,2016-12-12,Farm logs
Scott Andrew,4,2016-10-05,Canadian fields I farmer within 14 miles of the Canada/USA border. Please extend all the options USA farmers get and made available for me please. Also notice some discrepancies with the rain fall compared to a rain gauge
A Google user,4,2016-10-12,Food plotter
A Google user,4,2016-09-08,I get emails telling me that I've gotten rain on some farms on the day it rains.... but the app only shows rain 23 days ago....the app is not keeping up with the emails....other than that it is very useful
Mark Simpkins,2,2016-08-27,"Rain fall App says I have gotten rain, but won't show me how much.  Not impressed at all."
Scott Einsele,3,2016-08-12,What Happened Have had the app  since June and at first it was great. Now It shows I have had no rain in 21 days yet online under daily rainfall  it shows I am getting rain. Not being home much I was counting on this app but now I am unsure.
Brent Miller,5,2016-07-27,Farm logs It works very well
Karl Knuteson,2,2016-07-06,As a small vegetable farmer/ market gardener the ability to look at a chart and see a list of daily and weekly rainfall amounts is great which is why I like the website. It's annoying that when logging into the website from phone browser I am asked to use the app. The charts for viewing rainfall on the app are useless. Would give it 4 stars if you could view rainfall in the daily/ weekly chart like you can on the website. Would give 5 stars if you could record multiple crops per field as well.
Nancy Hopper,5,2016-06-16,Great App! Very accurate!
Dean Wilson,5,2016-06-04,Very useful
Martin Overturf,4,2016-04-26,Retired Happy working well

Dale Wagner,4,2016-04-21,Owner Crops
shawn w,3,2016-02-24,I'm going to miss crop health updates There's NO way I can afford $2499 for the feature I liked the most. I'll just keep it and walk my field like always
Robert E. Jackson II.,5,2016-08-22,Amazing The app is great. It helps organize data and create more time for farming.
John hunte,5,2015-12-21,"Good app, simple to manage."
William Ploplis,4,2015-12-14,Like it Just started using it around the wastewater plant i work at. Cant wait to see how it helps during the summer months
anton elliot,1,2015-11-20,Wont let me add farm says invalid shape Im uninstalling now waste of time
David Landes,3,2015-11-28,Just great. Very organized. A lotta fun.
Jason Buttar,3,2015-10-20,"Rain fall info??? I love the idea of this app, but the rain fall amounts are usually low compared to what we actually get.  And also since the last update I can no  longer add farms always says my field shape is invalid"
Daniel Cook,4,2015-10-17,"I like the idea For people growing crops, I could see this being a very helpful and useful tool. But I would love to see either an update or a separate app for livestock. Could see this being very popular."
Eddie Grant,4,2015-10-20,"Soggyman Cattle, Cow calf operation & Hay round& square bales"
Russell Elley,3,2015-10-31,Rainfall wayoff Need to work on rainfall data
Heather Rochester,5,2015-09-26,Great app! This is the best app I found to manage my fields.  Love that it keeps up with rainfall amounts.  Great way to keep up with crops and field management.
Asa Phillips,5,2015-09-29,"Best yet. I've tried several other apps, and this is by far the best. Love the interface, and ease of navigation. Makes it just as easy as writing in my old notebook. Also great with the website. I love it! Please tell me your company is making one for cattle/livestock?"
Eric Burns,3,2015-09-12,"Rain off Lately I've noticed the rainfall amounts being way off. Last night I had 1.5"" in my rain gauge, but farm logs only reported .55"". I could see being off a tenth or so, but not an inch."
Terrance Jackson,3,2015-09-21,"Missing Crop I love the app and rain fall measurements, but it doesn't have my crop. I'm growing chestnuts and they're not among the list of choices."
Kurt Meyers,5,2015-08-27,Great App! Truly a great app. Very helpful. Authors are receptive of suggestions and respond quickly.
Ed Matthews,3,2015-09-06,"Hand Do it all ,that is ask of me"
Rogelio Guerra,5,2015-09-21,Great app It's a start to something great. Using it in MÃ©xico

Tresa Morris,3,2015-07-27,"Still crashing Just updated app, and it's still crashing when trying to add a new field. Also indicated rain on only 1field, when all 3 I have currently are within eyesight and definitely got the same rain last night."

Melody Pospisil,5,2015-06-15,Farmlogs Great app for keeping track of work and fields
Wesley Wieland,4,2015-06-12,"Going the wrong way... Crash problem fixed!  Well done, and thank you for responding(and fixing the issue!)  Very much like the health monitor.  Am using this app more and more, as well as the web site.  Still need the ability to assign notes and activities to a field group or selection of fields. Getting better...."
josh greaves,5,2015-05-28,Great Love this app I run a big dairy operation and its so easy to use need to make something that indicates stock in a paddock and strip fences I think 299 for the advance is a bit steep Maby 150-200 bucks? 10 out of 10 good work!!
Vance Johnson,5,2015-05-25,Convenient to use I like it for recording planting and spray operations. Would like to see some sort of scouting portion to it. Rainfall is really pretty accurate from what I've seen so far.
ThatGuy,4,2015-05-19,"Great app, needs tweaks Really like the software, customer service has been good.  I work in the agricultural research business, thus it would be nice if there was a free input area under Field Activities to custom list things such as field scouting, irrigation or fence repairs, and other general notes/activities."
Jonathan Nordstrom,3,2015-05-18,I think there is a bug or something Worked great until our last big rain.. It wasn't counting the rain it Said no rain when we got 2+ inches
Aaron Useldinger,1,2015-05-19,24 percent of my battery gone from farm logs? I don't think so. Uninstalling

Matt Carter,5,2014-12-18,Matt carter Very helpful
Brandon Yeakley,4,2014-12-11,Takes some time to get things figured out.  After that works really good to keep records.  It would be better if I could input data from my phone.  Unless I just have not figured that part out.
ronnie c,5,2014-12-08,Dead on love this app

Ashley Hire,4,2014-07-30,Getting there Please add the ability to use your mobile device to gps field layouts and perimeter.  Other than that great app
Carla Hatke,1,2014-03-25,Can't even access app Immediately goes to log in page. What log in does it want I haven't even registered yet!? Worthless!
spirtual 3rd eye,4,2014-04-23,Work in progress Go to their website they are just starting out ...so give them time ... look like from web that they will be the best... they are working on connecting to yield monitor of combine... and much more
Sandeep G. Khode,1,2014-02-18,Worst Not useful at all
Chan Cabalo,1,2014-03-28,Not user friendly.
A Google user,5,2012-08-31,"Very useful tool I love Farmlogs it helps me achieve my goal of keeping accurate records of what's going on, on the farm and Farmlogs mobile makes it even easier to keep my farm efficient and profitable. I never want to go without it, it is a must for evey farmer seeking to improve their operation."
A Google user,5,2019-06-18,Easy to use
rusty conlan,2,2018-05-10,"Was once the most invaluable app on my phone. I build large Solar 
Facilities. I could keep tabs on my facilities rainfall totals across the 
country. The removal of the map feature now makes this app not worth the 
space. Such a shame."
House Lights,2,2017-06-14,Worked good the first year this is the second year of using it and it is a hit and miss on rain falls now accurate any more. Had rain on my home farm watched it rain and it never even picked up a drop same on one of my other locations later last week completely missed the rain falls says we didn't get anything but it rained good. Have now deleted this app moving on to something better hopefully.
Ashetu Gojema,4,2017-10-28,How can i use the app.?or Mauser the field.
