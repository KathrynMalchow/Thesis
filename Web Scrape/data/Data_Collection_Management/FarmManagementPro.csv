Jonathon Ehlers,3,2018-10-06,"It is SOOO close! This is exactly what I was looking for, but it needs much more work. (Thus only 3 stars for now). The navigation home screen (with the blue buttons) and the hidden left tool bar feel redundant of each other. Consolidating many related tabs would serve you well. There are far too many buttons to sort through for the average farmer who has stuff to do. Labeling buttons with icons in addition to the text would also be more user friendly. It would also be great to record/upload GPS data on fields and for maintenance routine purposes, share maps with GIS points to employee accounts. Employee accounts that can receive invites to my specific farm would be a great addition so you could assign a specific task to an individual. People would seriously pay money for this! Again, overall its a GREAT start to this app! I will keep it around in case you do update and will update stars as earned. I really want this to succeed. I know little about app development, but if you want real farmer suggestions, I'd be happy to elaborate!"
Silverfire,2,2020-05-27,"Works... sometimes. Can't see notes without entering edit screen, can't add notes without edit screen, even though it'll let you type all you want. Wipes info (such as birth date) upon entering edit screen. Glitches and is slow. Awesome idea, awful execution. Sad, because it is truly a one of a kind app, and much needed."
Collins Acholah,4,2020-09-02,"Its an awesome app for record keeping. However, kindly include search handle in the fertilizer and sprays section to help sorting through the vast number of varities available. All in all i lpve it and have recomended it to a few more young farmers. Kudos"
Camfil Pty Ltd,1,2020-08-21,"In farming we have goats, sheeps, chickens, turkeys, cows, horses, etc please make sure that all the species are catered for because during stock take in makes confusing when other animals are not accounted for. If possible, let option to save animal type as option by the farmer , that will solve all the problem."
Brian Zivanai Masunga,3,2020-05-18,"It's fine but very slow, you also need to add a functionality which reminds me of pending vaccinations say ,10 days ahead of time. It also has to allow me to list all my annual vaccinations amd then remind me when it's approaching."
Pierre Viljoen,1,2021-09-05,Cant get my account fixed. Shows submission error. Need some assistance but cant get a hold of anyone. Like the app . Currently everything submitted undet crop is all the same date. Please help.
A Google user,3,2020-10-20,Great App so far. Still new at it. How about a search function in the sprays drop down box? Listing my most recent sprays at the top? Saves scrolling to the bottom every time
Carl Miller,1,2019-04-06,half the stuff dosnt work. hard to add/find animals and items. a better set out app with all these functions would be great
Gert Erasmus,3,2019-12-22,"Very nice app, would however like to customize the animal details, as well as the interface."
Christi Lavers,3,2020-02-17,"Need a tutorial on how to use! I spent a long time inputting information and it did not save. Finally got it to save, but it is not saving the notes."
Pierre Viljoen,3,2018-09-25,I truely enjoy the app. Want to buy it. Have some suggestions though. Needs a place to add all our seed purhases and the app needs to keep track of my stock.
UnBoxxTv,5,2020-05-13,You need to make all currency available with a converter so you can get your result in the user's local currency and USD but so far it's a good app. 💯👌
Arijit Bairagya,5,2019-11-05,Using this for couple of days.. needs some modifications for ui look and feel but the features are very useful ..
brokencc84,1,2021-02-13,"Tells you that you have to upgrade to use the app, after entering information on animal. Waste of time. If you are going to charge to use this app then put the price in the app store so people don't waste their time."
Nuno Luis Braga dos Santos,5,2019-11-04,Very well thought-out. I recommend for new farmers and old. Incredible farm management power in your hands.

Willow Way Ranch,3,2019-07-01,"I like the app but would be good if it also had dam under sire to put the mothers of individual animals and I'm not seeing an area for animal production like how many eggs we get a day or how many pounds of milk one doe produces in a day. If I'm over looking that, please let me know."
