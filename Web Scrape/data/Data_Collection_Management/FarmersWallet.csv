Ssebwato Charles,5,2022-03-02,Have been using this app for the last 5 months and indeed is a game changer in farming. Keep improving and bravo for good innovation team
Chris Syverson,5,2022-02-10,Love this app! We do produce farming and it is an essential part in our record keeping.
Rachel Rogers,2,2021-03-10,"Ads pop up at the most inopportune moments, such as when trying to add an expense. Once the ad is finished, and you X-it, the app has exited your progress on adding your expense, by bringing you automatically back to the main menu. I wouldn't be irritated if it was a one off thing, but it happened thrice in a row. Cant deal with that, sorry. Other than not being able to add expenses, it's a decent app. But I hate ads. 2/5."
FredRick Damoah,5,2020-05-26,"Nice interface. I'm yet to use it but having gone through it I think it'll be very helpful. It got the right kind of information and records I need to keep. Why do I need the pro version? I'm interested. Updated : This app is super good. I think is the best for every farmer. I'm really enjoying it. I only have little issue with it that needs to be fixed; the font colour for options for the expenditure category must be changed to black or to another colour, is white and is hard to see."
Christine Lincourt,5,2022-02-05,Highly recommend. Very easy to use and makes keeping track of farm income/ expenses very easy.
Amelia Keesman,4,2022-02-09,Does the app sync online? I just lost my phone and wondering if i have to restart once i download it again
Daniel Omaya,5,2019-07-22,"Exceptionally simple and straight forward! definitely, I will not stop recommending this app to others. I like the fact that I can choose the currency! You could improve further by creating a filter for income and expenses per farm item, to see viability of each farm item! Could you incorporate/develop an app for Livestock management especially stock management (Male, Female, Young, Adult, culled, etc)? Thanks and well done."
hussain zoeb,4,2021-01-24,App works and suits perfectly for my farm incomes and expenses tracking . Very User friendly . A suggestion if you could add an option of attaching a photo of the bill with the expenses and income . Also another option of entering receipts and payments . This would allow the farmer to completely keep track of everything . It would become a complete accounting app . All the very best to the developer üòäüëçüèº .
Jared Vik,4,2020-05-10,"I just started using the app and so far it's going to work fine for my little hobby operation. But it would be nice if I could track commodity sales volumes to individual customers in the analytics. I sell grain to small customers and I would like to be able to see how much volume (bushels, pounds, tons, etc) and how much money I've been paid for each customer."
C M,5,2020-04-13,Thanks you. So far its been great have had it almost 2 months now and it is helping me alot. Especially on the reminder at first thought oh good grief but than when i forgot to write something on one of the expenses when it reminded me the next day asking was there anything i was able to remember i had forgotten to put in the expense for the roll of hay. While some people might not think that is important to a person running the farm that needs to know where all the expenses go it is great
Bruno Weps,5,2020-01-29,I like this app for its usability and the accurate accounting. It has made record keeping easier for me and i can easily track my farming cashflow. The developer is also very responsive when i contact through support. Thanks for this innovation
alex wanyama,4,2020-06-03,I like this app and it's really helped me a lot. I would like to suggest putting an option of taking/attaching a picture of receipts and invoices on the income and expense sections
dushyanth reddy,5,2020-03-06,Love the app. It would be great if you could add yield tracking option. So that I can keep track of how much yield I got in a season. It would be a great tool for vegetable farmers.
Harrison York,2,2020-12-17,I keep getting weekly reminders to upgrade to premium. But i upgraded in April. Any idea why this keeps happening? I feel like i need to turn off all notifications for this app.
Bruno Mweemba,5,2019-09-08,"Hi I signed up for the pro version but I can't get transaction details per day? The detailed reports must be able to be collapsed so that one is able to access information for a specific date or specific crop sold that day. Good app, kindly fix this"
Martyn Loveday,4,2020-05-23,"I use this app in analysis of income and costs for rice farming, milling and general farm agriculture. It works well and is easy to use once you have set up all the 'cash book' entries you require for analysis. As I use it more I will see if additions to the app might be suggested."
Joseph Matt Owori,5,2019-08-16,I like this app and I like the way the developer immediately responds to our feedback. Its getting better each and everyday. I don't even know how people with mean reviews here have appreciated anything given free of charge. Thumbs up to the developer. This is a nice innovation for any serious farmer.
Kana Albert,5,2019-11-04,"Awesome. Very clear and user friendly. Keeps tract of all my farm activities now... üëç. I love üòç it. I really wish I could go pro to export my data, but.... Thanks a lot for this version."

ADEYI SHOLA MA-VICS,4,2020-10-28,"Very good in keeping record, but should be upgraded where u can a log in detail so u can access on other devices Incase u change ur phone. Ur record will remain"
