Tom Redish,5,2021-03-09,"This is a great app for helping a grower understand why fertility recommendations are made, and illustrates why yeild goals and a good soil test are necessary to make an accurate recommendation."

Riley Anderson,5,2017-12-12,I love the app I use it a lot. 1 question can you add micro nutrients under the oat tab?   Thank you for everything you guys do for us.  Riley Anderson

fer,3,2016-07-11,"Some recent update has messed with the yield units. I can open up a crop, list the units will say ""cwt"" but when I email or save the crop, the units change to tons, but the nutrient numbers don't change. I'm sure there is a significant difference between 20 cwt and 20 tons for nutrient requirements. It makes reading actual requirements a bit difficult when you have to figure out what yield and units it's actually using."
Joey King,3,2017-04-18,"App is okay, doesn't include most nut crops. Doesn't include the standard weight measurements for most California crops. Could easily import western fertilizer handbook statistics. I'm uninstalling because it doesn't apply to me."
Mark Peck,5,2016-07-16,Fertilize needed With this I know just what to put on fields wish it gave micro nutrients for all crops
Justin Sangster,3,2016-07-11,No decimal point Why is there no decimal point for partial units like there used to be.

Ben Klink,3,2016-04-08,"Tons? Yield goal by the ton is stupid. Old version used bushels, much easier. Fix!!!"
Jeremy Shank,4,2015-07-23,"Needs more specialty crops I would give this 5-stars if it had more specialty crops.  Snap/Green Beans, Apples, Asparagus, Zucchini, Yellow Squash, Butternut Squash"

Geoff Bruckner,2,2013-11-24,Needs options for nutrients Conventions for nutrients naming/monitoring vary between countries. In Australia we generally track elemental P....not phosphate . It would been nice to been able to customise what is reported.
