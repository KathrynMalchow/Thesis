Ninni Bontich,5,2020-06-18,"Great app, does what it is ment to do. Makes feeding cows very easy, I wouldn't be without the crop counculator for working out fodder beet during transition. I use it daily. Only upgrade would be to be able to add supplement to total kg/dm. But that can be calculated in a separate working anyway. I would recommend this app."
