Ben Rudy,1,2019-05-03,"It pops up to accept the terms then has a pop up that says there was an error with the update process and to click ok. The program locks up at the point and I have to force it closed. I have used the app a lot in the past, now I have to find something else if it exists!"
Diana Olsen,2,2019-05-31,I'm very disappointed. I've used this app for years and now everytime I try to open it a message pops up error in updates and it closes. I've lost all my saved tank mixes and can't use this app. I have uninstalled and installed gone to app settings nothing works. Not a happy camper here
A Google user,1,2019-03-25,"I just downloaded this app on my phone because I have used it before and was able to utilize it for mixing chemicals on the farm. I am now disappointed because when I try to open the app, it says it can't update. I have tried to uninstall and download it again and continue having the same problem."

Derek Wright,5,2019-06-10,ek dink dit is baie help pende app die love it dit werk cool sal dit meer gebruik.
dustin hall,5,2019-01-26,The accept tab now works! This app helps save time when mixing a few chemicals together and when switching tank sizes. Works great on other devices but I can't get past the Accept screen. My phone is a Samsung Galaxy S8+ please help.
Kenneth Hanna,1,2018-05-05,"Looks like a great app but it won't work on my phone. I have a Motorola 
Moto and after I load it it asked me to read the agreement and accept. And 
when I hit the accept button it does nothing. I can't get past that point. 
I uninstalled and reinstalled sure will times and still the same problem. 
Let me know when you have this problem fixed because I would love to try 
your app."
Ethan Leadbeater,3,2018-05-22,"Great concept. The calculator feature is handy. I cannot get any labels to 
pull up. I have a pdf viewer installed. It opens in the viewer but never 
loads the label. I am connected to the internet. Any tips?"
Todd Weis,1,2017-12-06,"After install; initial opening of the app requires you to accept Terms of Use. However the ""Accept"" button is not working , therefore you cannot use the app.  Maybe apps needs an update since it was written in 2015 and I'm using it on Android 8.0.0?  Hopefully this gets fixed soon so I can provide better review."
Dan Renz,2,2018-04-14,"Accept button for terms of use acts like it is going to work but does nothing so cannot use it, had it on previous phone and worked great, but no more I guess."
kyle nichols,4,2018-08-02,"I've been using it since it came out but when my phone updated the app

spraying"
dave willis,5,2018-05-25,"Great app when it was on my lg v10. But does not work on my Google pixel2

William Attebury,3,2017-07-06,Wasn't really what I was looking for. I am looking for a pesticide/herbicide app that list the product names plus their generic equivalents.
A Google user,1,2018-06-26,Used it all the time on old phone but won't work on new one
Vickie Powers,1,2018-08-13,"This app will not work on the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus. Very disappointed 
that it won't."
Luca Candela,2,2017-10-19,Doesn't go past the policy on a new installation on Oreo. Needs an update.

Adee Bosman,4,2013-11-10,Granuals Please add grams per liter for granual chemicals. Otherwise its a nice app.
Shawn McFarland,3,2014-02-21,Add a sq ft option. I would love to see a sq ft. option to be used in residential applications.
Sh√§nda De Anda,5,2014-09-11,Runs even on my old phone. Simple to use interface that's elegant and easy to follow. I have android 2.1 and this works smooth.
Jacob S,2,2014-08-01,Looks like a very useful app. If I could just download it.
john casey,4,2014-12-16,Granules. Would like to have grams and kilograms added for Australian users.
Ausguard resgon,5,2014-03-01,Great game it seems like but... It won't let me download it
Randy Souza,4,2014-09-13,Farm manager Very helpful !!!
Kevin Kundel,5,2013-07-03,Great app I love that the new version lets me edit the rates of chemicals in the same mix without starting over. The ability to send the mix is also great. I can send it to the person mixing for me from the sprayer. Great app. THANKS!
A Google user,2,2012-07-19,"With a few tweaks, this could be a go-to app, but is not very useful to me as it is.  The pre-populated lists of chemicals are really nice, but the work flow doesn't lend itself to the way I load a sprayer.  If a Taplogic developer reads this, please consider the following enhancements:  1.  Allow saving a recipe (all ingredients plus rate per acre and max tank size) independent of acres to be sprayed. 2.  On the ""Total Materials"" report screen, also list the total volume of the solution in gallons."
A Google user,3,2012-05-26,"Nice for farming but... Not very applicable for commercial applicators. Would be GREAT to have the option of sq./ft. not just by the acre. Also, chemicals from Wilbur-Ellis for commercial/residential turf applications would make a nice addition."
A Google user,4,2012-02-27,Tank mixes Need to be able to save a tank mix then be able to apply it to a different amount of acres.  Not just saved in history to one certain amount of acreage. Other than that good app.
A Google user,3,2012-02-23,Farmmer1 Needs ability top calculate in metric chemical doseage (ie) liters/acre
Mike Trueman,2,2013-02-25,"Limited No products for small grains farmers or R&P customers. Very Very limited!!!!!!! No Dow, Dupont, BASF, Bayer, its mainly a generic glyphosate and that's it app"
Chris Stockman,4,2013-03-13,Chemicals Its almost planting time. Are you going to put all the chemicals onto the list. It is short chemicals.
A Google user,4,2012-03-10,Nice Would be nice if it had the option of 28% instead of water and nitrogen stabilizers like instinct.
Josh,4,2013-01-10,Lack of chemicals Needs more chemicals such as viper
Bob,2,2013-06-21,Can you make this in metric? All the chemicals are in metric.
Brian Hershberger,5,2013-07-03,Quite the time saver. I look forward to the addition of square footage!
Reggie Parsons,5,2013-04-28,Great app Very useful
A Google user,5,2012-05-19,Perfect Does just what I wanted.
A Google user,4,2011-09-11,"Nice start You need to add the ability to save tank mixes after they are created for use later. No sense having to create them again when you want to use them a second time. You also need the ability to quickly calculate a ""partial fill"" when you need to fill less than a full load."
A Google user,5,2011-08-27,Nice app Simple and works well. I really like the integrated chemical list.
A Google user,1,2011-12-31,Very poor calculations Doesn't subtract the products added from total carrier needed.
A Google user,5,2011-12-09,Eric Very nice and handy. My one and only suggestion is to be able to delete the history if need be.
A Google user,1,2018-08-13,"This app does not work with the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus. Very disappointed 
that it doesn't. It will not let me accept the terms to allow me to use the 
app. Developer should definitely fix this for all users nd not just iOS 
users."
Kevin Shields,5,2018-05-14,"It was a wonderful app. Used it for years. Got a new phone and reinstalled 
and now it won't let me past the terms and conditions. Sad, now I will have 
to find a different one."
A Google user,5,2012-07-04,This is the Best mixing app I have been able to find. There are some things I'd like to see changed but this app leads all others.
A Google user,1,2012-05-16,Not metric Would work well if you could use metric units
A Google user,1,2018-08-11,"$12.99 lost and no way to get refund. App installed, but didn't ""accept"" 
the EULA ""accept"" button on HTC Android. Oh, well."
Mark Halquis49,1,2018-05-24,Can accept to open app
Denny Holdeman,3,2018-03-23,It needs square footage
Sunil Desai,4,2015-01-05,Very usefull for progressive farmer.
