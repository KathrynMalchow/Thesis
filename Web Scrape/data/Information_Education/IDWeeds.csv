I was able scroll and use all of the features of the app I was able to quickly identify weeds with no knowledge of botany in my sheep pasture. I found out that a couple of ""weeds"" are great forbs for my sheep to eat. So, I didn't remove them; however, I will monitor them to make sure they don't get out of control. Thanks creating this app!"
Charlie bright,1,2021-07-03, Outdated much post. Modern tech like camera does the work for you.although they are shhizztersz.
Sheila Brown,1,2019-08-30, Very limited questions! Pictures not helpful. Can't enlarge them.
Derek Stuhmer,2,2020-08-14, Doesn't display pictures and rarely works correctly.
Adam Thornton,1,2021-04-23, App basically doesn't work. Pictures don't load.
"James Keenan, Jr",1,2020-06-03, It keeps telling me I cannot find any search results
Neil Cook,5,2020-10-27, Easy to identify weeds in my yard and information on how to kill them.
Roger Gy,1,2020-08-24, Picture links broken
Wende Henderson,1,2019-05-23, this app sucks!!!!!
Jeffrey Edwards,5,2021-06-30, Work good
Pamra Thurman,2,2020-08-18," When you click on the weed listing, no images will show. Just broken link. You have to know the name of the weed in order to look it up. If I know name, wouldn't need to look it up."
H B,5,2017-07-02," It's a really good app given you have the knowledge of plant terminology. Would be nice to get a broader range of results if the search becomes too narroe instead of it saying ""no weeds were found"""
Gregory Jordan,5,2017-09-05, Lets you identify weeds by their features.  Just input what you can identify and it will show you a list of possible plants.  Works without an internet connection so you don't have to worry about internet service when in the field.
Alvin H,1,2017-09-14, Horrible as it is now. I want to like it as it seems like it has a lot of potential. But HOW am I supposed to use it if I can't scroll down to read plant descriptions?! Useless.
a2K DontNeedToKnow,3,2017-07-13," The app, and filters, and weed library seem great, but on my Moto G4 ay, I cannot scroll down on the data pages for a weed as I try to read about it. Please fix this! I want to love this app."
Kate Maier,3,2017-10-04, There is a serious bug that prevents me from scrolling the description on my Android device. I can only read the first few lines.
A Google user,5,2017-10-12, Easy to use plant i.d. with pics and both common and scientific names
Robert Shockley,5,2016-10-01,"Wonderful ""Hands On"" App If you want to dig in and Learn this is the app! I had been using Ver. 2.1.1, I accidentally stumbled across this update, Listed as a 2nd app. Picture ID would be nice for use, but not as a ag, horticulture or biology teaching aid.

A Google user,1,2016-09-03,"Waaaay too much work! Too many steps, no taking a picture option, and nothing less than digging up the plant for a description of its roots and knowing its flower color if its not blooming.....are you kidding me! I dropped this app like a hot potato!"
Jeanine Yellman,2,2016-06-30,"Not what I thought. You will need to document every feature and characteristic of the plant, including digging it up and examining the root structure.   If you choose to go by the extensive list,  it scrolls all the way back to the top of the list as opposed to bringing you back to where you started from.  You can use ...Full ReviewYou will need to document every feature and characteristic of the plant, including digging it up and examining the root structure.   If you choose to go by the extensive list,  it scrolls all the way back to the top of the list as opposed to bringing you back to where you started from.  You can use the list by choosing one letter of the alphabet, but if I knew what the weeds were called, I WOULDN'T NEED THIS APP."
Carrie D,3,2016-05-04,"Was expecting more........ This app is very organized with a variety of different types of weeds, just not the ones that I was searching for and then I noticed the ones I did check out there was no info on how to get rid of them which is what I thought it would include...."
erin hawley,2,2017-06-04," I'm using a pixel XL, and the app does not work properly. I cannot scroll except in tiny increments."
Hill Wellford,1,2017-06-08," Doesn't work on Google pixel. Can't advance to the next step, it freezes."
Bernie Lopez,1,2017-03-23, Take this trash out of the system
Martha Lane,1,2016-07-01, Won't accept even the common name.
A Google user,5,2018-08-29, Cant say yet?
M B,5,2016-03-25, Goodbye weeds!
Matthew George,5,2021-07-05, Great job.
