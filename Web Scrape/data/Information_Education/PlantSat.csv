Bobby Basnet,5,2021-01-25,"This app is amazing, it allows you to view health status of the pants in farm anywhere in the world, using satellite data, for free. I never even knew such data and it's visualization of farms was possible. I love these visualizations and track random lands in random countries to compare the performance of farms in different regions."
rajina shrestha,5,2021-03-27,I used the app to get some advice on plants I was working on for my academic thesis. The answers I received from the experts on my problems were comprehensive and solution oriented. They were detailed enough for me to mention in my academic writing as well. Recommend this to everyone!
