Prashant Adhikari,5,2021-10-29,I love the design of your app. I just installed it and wow ... it looks absolutely good. Best experienced... But i think there is issue or you can call it bug ... your app is crashed after triple click to your home button. So fix it along with your version and serve the best result to your users. Thank you‚ò∫‚ò∫
Rihan Khan,1,2021-10-10,This is worst app. If you will order by agriapp then you will be wail only wait and if you will try to contact then they will not respond you. I wait for 2 week for 1 product. There is no option to give zero and also in minus rating otherwise I give rate in minus. I suggest to play store that play store should be option to rate in minus. Ok Thanks.
