"2" "Forest Health" 1 2019-07-09 "extremely inaccurate. you are much better off training your crews eye and estimating. this app simply doesn't work with coverage over 40%. it does work in low density, I guess, low density can be hard... I'm still looking for a replacement for GLAMA. why did it get pulled."
"3" "Sanjay Naithani" 1 2021-07-16 "I can't rate it because I can't login. It doesn't work on Android 10."
"4" "deniscb" 5 2021-06-09 "Simple to use & appears to be pretty accurate"
"5" "Sobhy Mohamed" 3 2021-09-04 "I CAN'T MAKE AN ACCOUNT IN THE MOBILE APP.. I MADE IT TWO TIMES WITH DIFFERENT DATA THEN TELL ME USER OR PASSWORD MAY BE WRONGR"
"6" "Nur Ilmi" 5 2020-04-03 "This app has really helped my in doing my final year project. Thank you developers for this app."
"7" "Shishpal Poonia" 5 2019-08-12 "excellent to use in field !!"
"8" "Desale Kidane" 5 2019-09-17 "I found this mobile application very important to do researches about water productivity using AquaCrop model"
"9" "Spectrum Research Services" 5 2018-03-19 "This is a very helpful tool in assessment of field trials of the effects of various treatments on plant growth/canopy cover - takes out the guesswork of estimating plant row cover. Very useful"
"10" "colby berry" 5 2017-04-05 "Pretty cool app that i stumbled upon by accident. Can't wait to use it on an actual field instead of my yard."
"11" "Septian Nugroho P" 5 2018-05-23 "Tai"
"12" "Badrul Azhar" 5 2020-10-01 "Useful app"

"15" "Brenda Matewere" 5 2021-11-08 "Nice"
"16" "Ssebwato Charles" 5 2022-03-02 "Have been using this app for the last 5 months and indeed is a game changer in farming. Keep improving and bravo for good innovation team"
"17" "Chris Syverson" 5 2022-02-10 "Love this app! We do produce farming and it is an essential part in our record keeping."
"18" "Rachel Rogers" 2 2021-03-10 "Ads pop up at the most inopportune moments, such as when trying to add an expense. Once the ad is finished, and you X-it, the app has exited your progress on adding your expense, by bringing you automatically back to the main menu. I wouldn't be irritated if it was a one off thing, but it happened thrice in a row. Cant deal with that, sorry. Other than not being able to add expenses, it's a decent app. But I hate ads. 2/5."
"19" "FredRick Damoah" 5 2020-05-26 "Nice interface. I'm yet to use it but having gone through it I think it'll be very helpful. It got the right kind of information and records I need to keep. Why do I need the pro version? I'm interested. Updated : This app is super good. I think is the best for every farmer. I'm really enjoying it. I only have little issue with it that needs to be fixed; the font colour for options for the expenditure category must be changed to black or to another colour, is white and is hard to see."
"20" "Christine Lincourt" 5 2022-02-05 "Highly recommend. Very easy to use and makes keeping track of farm income/ expenses very easy."
"21" "Amelia Keesman" 4 2022-02-09 "Does the app sync online? I just lost my phone and wondering if i have to restart once i download it again"
"22" "Daniel Omaya" 5 2019-07-22 "Exceptionally simple and straight forward! definitely, I will not stop recommending this app to others. I like the fact that I can choose the currency! You could improve further by creating a filter for income and expenses per farm item, to see viability of each farm item! Could you incorporate/develop an app for Livestock management especially stock management (Male, Female, Young, Adult, culled, etc)? Thanks and well done."
"23" "hussain zoeb" 4 2021-01-24 "App works and suits perfectly for my farm incomes and expenses tracking . Very User friendly . A suggestion if you could add an option of attaching a photo of the bill with the expenses and income . Also another option of entering receipts and payments . This would allow the farmer to completely keep track of everything . It would become a complete accounting app . All the very best to the developer <U+0001F60A><U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FC> ."
"24" "Jared Vik" 4 2020-05-10 "I just started using the app and so far it's going to work fine for my little hobby operation. But it would be nice if I could track commodity sales volumes to individual customers in the analytics. I sell grain to small customers and I would like to be able to see how much volume (bushels, pounds, tons, etc) and how much money I've been paid for each customer."
"25" "C M" 5 2020-04-13 "Thanks you. So far its been great have had it almost 2 months now and it is helping me alot. Especially on the reminder at first thought oh good grief but than when i forgot to write something on one of the expenses when it reminded me the next day asking was there anything i was able to remember i had forgotten to put in the expense for the roll of hay. While some people might not think that is important to a person running the farm that needs to know where all the expenses go it is great"
"26" "Bruno Weps" 5 2020-01-29 "I like this app for its usability and the accurate accounting. It has made record keeping easier for me and i can easily track my farming cashflow. The developer is also very responsive when i contact through support. Thanks for this innovation"
"27" "alex wanyama" 4 2020-06-03 "I like this app and it's really helped me a lot. I would like to suggest putting an option of taking/attaching a picture of receipts and invoices on the income and expense sections"
"28" "dushyanth reddy" 5 2020-03-06 "Love the app. It would be great if you could add yield tracking option. So that I can keep track of how much yield I got in a season. It would be a great tool for vegetable farmers."
"29" "Harrison York" 2 2020-12-17 "I keep getting weekly reminders to upgrade to premium. But i upgraded in April. Any idea why this keeps happening? I feel like i need to turn off all notifications for this app."
"30" "Bruno Mweemba" 5 2019-09-08 "Hi I signed up for the pro version but I can't get transaction details per day? The detailed reports must be able to be collapsed so that one is able to access information for a specific date or specific crop sold that day. Good app, kindly fix this"
"31" "Martyn Loveday" 4 2020-05-23 "I use this app in analysis of income and costs for rice farming, milling and general farm agriculture. It works well and is easy to use once you have set up all the 'cash book' entries you require for analysis. As I use it more I will see if additions to the app might be suggested."
"32" "Joseph Matt Owori" 5 2019-08-16 "I like this app and I like the way the developer immediately responds to our feedback. Its getting better each and everyday. I don't even know how people with mean reviews here have appreciated anything given free of charge. Thumbs up to the developer. This is a nice innovation for any serious farmer."
"33" "Kana Albert" 5 2019-11-04 "Awesome. Very clear and user friendly. Keeps tract of all my farm activities now... <U+0001F44D>. I love <U+0001F60D> it. I really wish I could go pro to export my data, but.... Thanks a lot for this version."
"34" "Kirwana Fred" 5 2018-12-24 "Really useful. Nice interfaces and analytics. I had wanted this for a long time . keep up with the good work"
"35" "John Darling Nyendwa" 5 2020-07-28 "This is a very excellent App. It also reminds you to do certain things one takes for granted in sgriculture. Keep it up. Thanks."
"36" "Mohammad Zafar" 1 2019-12-23 "I appriciate 5 star but i will not. Coz i lost my data after mobile factory data resetting ( farmet ) i cant recover it . That's very important. I mail also to help desk. So its very wors app very bad West"
"37" "Zbrand" 5 2019-06-03 "great app. needs ability to chang date format. also being able to scan expense receipts would be great."
"38" "Guppy Nutty NZ" 5 2020-12-08 "Its easy to use, nice and basic. Perfcet for tracking fish breeding hobby costs and income."
"39" "Farm with Cloverdale" 5 2020-07-30 "Very easy to use ,easy to understand and keeps reminding you to record whenever you forget ."
"40" "Israel G Chidavaenzi" 4 2019-01-15 "A very good initiative that has potential as a game changer. I would love to see file sharing as part of this, well-done!"
"41" "ADEYI SHOLA MA-VICS" 4 2020-10-28 "Very good in keeping record, but should be upgraded where u can a log in detail so u can access on other devices Incase u change ur phone. Ur record will remain"
"42" "Adeola Ogunsakin" 3 2020-01-09 "Revenue and expence class created appears white on tranactions entry menu so it becomes invisible and difficult to select from the drop down list. Can you help resolve please?"

"44" "Sean Beazley" 4 2020-08-18 "Works good for keeping track of expenses. It really needs a spot to keep track of miles."

"46" "Buju Gonzalez" 4 2020-08-26 "Helpful but did not come with an assistance Some of the fields needs some explanation for a beginner It seems the target is to sell the product by urging user to go premium"
"47" "Dennis Madzingira" 5 2021-12-03 "Its a really wonderful mobile app that keeps us liquid and invest in other asset. Thank you development team."
"48" "Naveenprasanth Duraisamy" 5 2020-05-09 "It would be better you provide option add items or quantity and multiply rate of the item then total to amount spend or earn will help a lot Please consider this changes <U+0001F64F>"

"135" "charles muhongya" 5 2020-10-01 "Best app to have"
"136" "Jake Petzold" 1 2019-06-20 "Lower your price. Hundreds of comments saying it's a great app, but you set the price too high. We're willing to pay something, maybe like $5 a month for activities, rainfall, and heat units, and scale up from there with more features. You don't need to contact ME. Your company made an error in setting the prices too high The convenience of you aggregating free weather/soil data into a record keeping app is worth something....not $30. NDVI and some advanced marketing features may be worth 99/mo."
"137" "Craig DeVries" 1 2020-01-23 "WAS a great app. free to use version had a great organized layout for tracking expenses and profits. all of the activities and business plan data is input and modified by the user, so basically a glorified spreadsheet design with better user interface. and NOW, after inputting and tracking my data for 3 years......... I am forced to pay or move my data elsewhere. STAY AWAY!!! zero warning or perks for users utilizing their services. terrible business move. Farm at Hand is much better!!!"
"138" "scott boedeker" 2 2019-05-08 "when I first got the ap, it worked great. the rainfall totals were very close to the gauge totals. the previous \"update\" changed that, the totals were never even close. now, with the update on April 24th, it won't even open. when i try to open it hoping it is fixed, my phone locks up."
"139" "Janell K" 1 2019-03-30 "I used to enjoy this free app for simple tracking of rain fall. Now, without warning, they have changed subscription levels for the people that have helped them build and design this app, and are charging at least $120 per year for access to data which was free a month ago. User beware, their greediness has taken over, and it's sure to only get worse. I will be finding another platform to track data on my own property"
"140" "kyle Lien" 1 2019-05-23 "I found this app handy until I would have to pay $29/ month, so will be uninstalling. All i used was the rainfall tracking ( free information online) and logging activities (digital notepad or calendar would do). This app made it easy but Im not spending $29 a month or any amount for free information and a simple record of history."
"141" "Benjamin Dilworth" 1 2019-06-14 "after last update, app won't open properly. It just keeps flashing across the screen of my Google pixel. I had to cancel my subscription because they jacked the price way up, and the free app is worthless. I will now be uninstalling this app and subscribing to FBN where you get so much more for your money."
"142" "Alex Reppucci" 5 2019-11-23 "Such a helpful and handy app. The company I work for uses it daily. We just upgraded to complete and having some app crashing issues but the support team is exceptional at helping with everything! Definitely recommend!"
"143" "DellingerFarms LLC" 5 2019-08-08 "Our operation transitioned from multiple notebooks and spreadsheets to FarmLogs in 2017.  I love it.  Access to details any time.   The mobile app fits our hired help.  I prefer the web version.  We rely heavily on the activities.  Acreage reporting is a breeze now.  Product totals calculated from the rates and acres makes a good check against what we paid for. I'd suggest FL tweak the SprayLog report to meet Dicamba record requirements. That would be huge. Thanks for the excellent cust service!"
"144" "Luke Berner" 3 2019-02-23 "The app is good and easy to use, a little disappointed about the high cost of the new subscription coming at a time where funds are already short on the farm. Also need to add livestock"
"145" "Boyohboy" 1 2020-10-27 "Too much money for what it offers. Missing a lot of chemicals in their application part, missing some very common fertilizers in our area, and have way more marketing garbage than a fellow ever needs. I wish I could find a app that would just let me track what I have done in each field."
"146" "Gregg Campbell" 3 2018-11-09 "There is no cumulative function when tracking rainfall. Every new alert for rainfall changes all previous alerts to the most current alert, very awkward to track cumulative totals without writing them down, really?"
"147" "andrea king" 3 2021-01-12 "The free version is somewhat helpful but the cheapest paid plan being $65/month is ridiculous! It does not come close to being worth that much money for what you get."
"148" "A Google user" 1 2019-03-14 "I use this app to track rainfall on the food plots we plant on our hunting property. Rainfall accuracy was only so-so compared to our rain gauge but at least the app showed you rainfall history. Now they're charging $29 per month for that - NFW! The free Lite version of this app is worthless, there is nothing in it. Goodbye FarmLogs!!!!"
"149" "Greg Outdoors" 2 2019-05-07 "Understanding nothing is free, but 29.99/month!? I was grateful to find this app for tracking heat and rainfall actuals on our new homestead-to-be, given we haven't even established any type of yard or garden/beds, we were eager to make the most of this app for our micro-scale of future mini homestead, but again~ $360/yr. is far to rich for us/our minisucle needs. $30/yr for rainfall&heat historical data w/ current actuals, sold. Consider small scale homesteader version for annual sub option"
"150" "Jon Dorothy" 1 2021-05-20 "Pointless, used to be good to track rain(ish never was very accurate) and manually enter field work. Now wants to charge an exhorbant amount of money with no options other than a lot of money or an extreme amount of money, no matter how many acres you are trying to manage (5 acres or 5000 acres) if it were to charge you something more understandable like $0.01 per acre per month for usable field data it would possibly be debatable but currently no absolutely worthless application. 0/5 <U+0001F31F>"
"151" "John Neidigh" 4 2020-08-27 "Have a friend who swears by this app, but not what I need, and the LAST thing I'm gonna do is sign up for any \"free trial\" just to see more than how to draw a field! Not to mention there isn't even any home button to excape the freebie pitch page rabbit hole."
"152" "A Google user" 5 2019-02-23 "Great, multifunctional app that pairs nicely with the FarmLogs web platform. Easy to use with a nice clean format. Before the update I've really utilized the \"Products\" function to keep track of our farm input inventory. FarmLogs team is also very responsive to feedback in order to make their app fit your operation. It's true that pricing for this has changed, but if you price other programs with similar features, FarmLogs is still the value option."
"153" "Farmer04" 1 2019-02-25 "WAS a wonderful app it did everything i wanted too. I have 2 years of data, and now you have to pay to use the most simple things!!! REALLY?!?!?!?! This is ridiculous!!! STAY AWAY. greedy developers!!!"
"154" "Paul Reinarz" 4 2020-06-17 "The app is a bit finicky and stops now and again (hence 4 stars) but is a good companion to the web app. The support team was eager to help me out and persisted until my concerns had been meet."
"155" "Matt Welte" 1 2019-02-07 "99$ a month to manually record activities is ridiculous. Time to find something else that matches the cost/benefit better. Used to be a big fan of this but not for 99$ a month"
"156" "Justin Harris" 1 2019-04-14 "Was a great app but its useless now. Started charging for the rainfall history feature without any notice. I used this app and quit recording it by hand and now all is lost. WILL NOT recommend this app anymore. sorry"
"157" "Howard Stephenson" 1 2019-02-17 "This app was a nice app. Now they are just pure greedy. The owners just keep wanting more money for everything. This app is no longer worth having and I have stopped recommending it to my fellow farmers. The latest $$ grab is for rain and heat history.. I do not reccomend even trying this app."
"158" "Mike Jarrett" 1 2019-04-25 "worked ok for a couple years. Now they want to charge an large sum for you to continue. Hence make comparing records from last year to this impossible. Probably a decent app for corn or beans, but I grow hops. It won't let me list my chemicals."
"159" "Bryan K" 1 2021-05-08 "Used to be a useful app to track activities and notes. Now you can't do much of anything without paying. Useless unless your a big farmer. Save your time and stay away"
"160" "Bryan Robason" 1 2019-06-18 "app once again has stopped working. go to open, and it locks down Samsung note 9. if your going to charge money for your app, atleast make sure its it's working."
"161" "Tim Faulk" 2 2019-07-20 "This app. WAS pretty cool...now you have to pay for everything but the weather/rain. I can get that information a dozen other places...I gurss its time to STOP CLUTTERING UP MY PHONE WITH IT!!!!!"
"162" "Shawn Kisling" 3 2019-04-18 "Really liked the app at first. but lately their rainfall estimates are horrible and they made it so you need to subscribe in order to view rainfall charts."
"163" "Jennifer" 1 2019-05-08 "This was an awesome app for rainfall and history of rainfall, but you all got greedy. so uninstalling. I can Google rainfall history for free."
"164" "Herman van den Berg" 1 2019-04-26 "Loved this app in the past but is useless now that we have to pay for it. I only used it to keep track of what we did and when we did it on fields and dont think it's worth it to pay $99 a month just for that."
"165" "justin andrews" 2 2019-08-27 "It was good until they went to charging $30 month. In my opinion this APP has priced itself out of the market."
"166" "Kenneth Lake" 1 2020-05-15 "Free version of the app has a banner on every page, \"example data\", therefore useless."
"167" "Alan Schwartz" 1 2020-11-11 "Won't let me log in and log in screen is jacked up can't enter the letter I'm pushing it enters the one next to it"
"168" "RC Wayt" 3 2019-06-08 "love the app but since the last update it wont open it just flashes black and white on my screen"
"169" "Cole Harmon" 1 2020-01-09 "Used to be a great app, but they got greedy. Now 70<U+2105> of the app is locked behind a paywall."
"170" "Shawn Comes" 1 2019-04-07 "was a good app now sucks. your over charging for what you get history of rain and heat. and charging for soil types that public record"
"171" "cindy hooker" 2 2021-05-20 "Used to be decent until changes and charginging for formally free parts of the app"
"172" "Josh Tschappat" 2 2019-06-02 "app fails and when it does work it's not that accurate"
"173" "Darwin's w Hofer" 2 2019-05-24 "this app was working excellent until last week..refused open"
"174" "Matt Hennig" 1 2020-03-05 "Used to have wonderful rainfall and gdu charts suddenly for 2020 what I've enjoyed free for some years is $29 per month"
"175" "Dustin Goehring" 1 2019-05-17 "used to be the best app on the market but apparently they got money hungry too"
"176" "Anthony Philyaw" 1 2018-10-18 "The app is broken and cannot be opened."
"177" "Anthony Huhn" 2 2019-07-26 "once you update now they want you to pay for heat units and soil map!"
"178" "Jason Kolar" 1 2019-02-20 "used to be good as a free app, not worth the money they are asking"
"179" "A Google user" 1 2019-03-21 "When is the Rainfall Chart History coming back to the basic app?"

"182" "Marianne McCoy" 1 2019-04-18 "started charging for rain history. um, no!"

"187" "Collin Blatt" 5 2019-08-04 "Could you add the ability to connect one's social media accounts to make sign in simpler? EDIT: Nice app, but I can't view soil types on fields for free anymore?"
"188" "Gordon Thomas" 2 2019-06-27 "Gives me what i need at my finger tips. However, they are pricing themselves in their in app purchase too expensive."
"189" "Agri Dev" 5 2019-08-14 "great"
"190" "James Ryen" 1 2019-05-23 "This app is now a glorified rain guage. All the features we have found useful from the start you now have to pay for. Farm logs, if you are wanting to address my concerns, change it back to what it was last year!!!"
"191" "D H" 1 2019-04-01 "I also thought it WAS a great tool to have, (5 star) until they started charging to use the app. Us farmers are trying to make ends meet with crop price at a 20+ year low, it would be nice not to be nickeled and dimed at every turn. My grandfather once told me \"when farmers make money, everyone makes money\""
"192" "Scott Holdeman" 1 2019-02-15 "absolute junk. after you get all your data put in they decide to do an update and now you have to pay for it. it's not worth paying for"
"193" "Craig Smith" 1 2019-02-21 "GOODBYE"
"194" "Kevin Feddersen" 1 2019-04-21 "Just like everyone else has said, was a great app but now they want paid, very typical."
"195" "Justin ogan" 5 2018-12-08 "This app is amazing! I have been using it for 3 years to keep records, track rainfall, and plan for future years. Would be lost without it. They update it frequently, and are very helpful. The new market feature is very nice. It is a great way to watch expenses and keep track of inventory! Awesome!"
"196" "Carol Grubel" 3 2018-08-26 "Used to love this App. Since the last. Update and new update to the phone mobile phone system, the rainfall totals don't update. Some fields do while others don't. I'm sure it rained on those fields because of the close proximity."

"200" "Patrick Scott" 4 2018-06-12 "I have loved this app until recently it has started freezing up my phone. I 
uninstalled it to redo it and the haven't been able to reinstall. 
Reinstalled after waiting a day I and is working now."

"203" "Douglas Lowell" 5 2021-04-08 "Very helpful"
"204" "A Google user" 5 2018-01-24 "Great app but would really be great if I could drop points and name them in the soil maps when I'm pulling soil samples so I could come back to the same spot later."
"205" "Jason Alberts" 1 2019-04-06 "well, bye!"
"206" "Luke Henneke" 4 2017-12-13 "Seems like a great app but would be nice if u could update the maps since they are from like 2010"
"207" "Y V" 2 2017-11-07 "What happened to the map feature? I cannot check my fields using the map view anymore. It seems you have replaced it with activities instead. The only I can check my fields is through list view. The map feature was why I kept using farm logs. Please put it back."
"208" "Brad & Cassie Wans" 4 2017-07-07 "While it's true this app is designed more for row crop farms, I use it on our hay ground to keep track of rainfall. We background 1000 dairy heifers, so we go through a lot of hay in a year! I start cutting middle of April and finish in September and October. Rainfall tracking is very important to manage fertilizer applications among other things. I can look at the app and see if a farm 20 miles away got any rain last night. That beats going to the feed store and listening to all the old timers as they guess how much they got. I can just open the app and show them how wrong they are. Worth it's weight in gold for that reason alone!"
"209" "A Google user" 4 2017-06-07 "I love this app. I'm not a very big farmer but I love growing crops. I would download this app again if It got deleted today."
"210" "Nick Hatcher" 2 2017-04-10 "The new menus for seed selection is terrible, gave up on scrolling and put variety in the notes"

"216" "Mark Simpkins" 2 2016-08-27 "Rain fall App says I have gotten rain, but won't show me how much.  Not impressed at all."
"217" "Scott Einsele" 3 2016-08-12 "What Happened Have had the app  since June and at first it was great. Now It shows I have had no rain in 21 days yet online under daily rainfall  it shows I am getting rain. Not being home much I was counting on this app but now I am unsure."
"218" "Brent Miller" 5 2016-07-27 "Farm logs It works very well"
"219" "Karl Knuteson" 2 2016-07-06 "As a small vegetable farmer/ market gardener the ability to look at a chart and see a list of daily and weekly rainfall amounts is great which is why I like the website. It's annoying that when logging into the website from phone browser I am asked to use the app. The charts for viewing rainfall on the app are useless. Would give it 4 stars if you could view rainfall in the daily/ weekly chart like you can on the website. Would give 5 stars if you could record multiple crops per field as well."

"231" "Jason Buttar" 3 2015-10-20 "Rain fall info??? I love the idea of this app, but the rain fall amounts are usually low compared to what we actually get.  And also since the last update I can no  longer add farms always says my field shape is invalid"
"232" "Daniel Cook" 4 2015-10-17 "I like the idea For people growing crops, I could see this being a very helpful and useful tool. But I would love to see either an update or a separate app for livestock. Could see this being very popular."

"236" "Asa Phillips" 5 2015-09-29 "Best yet. I've tried several other apps, and this is by far the best. Love the interface, and ease of navigation. Makes it just as easy as writing in my old notebook. Also great with the website. I love it! Please tell me your company is making one for cattle/livestock?"
"237" "Eric Burns" 3 2015-09-12 "Rain off Lately I've noticed the rainfall amounts being way off. Last night I had 1.5\" in my rain gauge, but farm logs only reported .55\". I could see being off a tenth or so, but not an inch."

"248" "josh greaves" 5 2015-05-28 "Great Love this app I run a big dairy operation and its so easy to use need to make something that indicates stock in a paddock and strip fences I think 299 for the advance is a bit steep Maby 150-200 bucks? 10 out of 10 good work!!"
"249" "Vance Johnson" 5 2015-05-25 "Convenient to use I like it for recording planting and spray operations. Would like to see some sort of scouting portion to it. Rainfall is really pretty accurate from what I've seen so far."
"250" "ThatGuy" 4 2015-05-19 "Great app, needs tweaks Really like the software, customer service has been good.  I work in the agricultural research business, thus it would be nice if there was a free input area under Field Activities to custom list things such as field scouting, irrigation or fence repairs, and other general notes/activities."

I never want to go without it, it is a must for evey farmer seeking to improve their operation."
"276" "A Google user" 5 2019-06-18 "Easy to use"
"277" "rusty conlan" 2 2018-05-10 "Was once the most invaluable app on my phone. I build large Solar 
Facilities. I could keep tabs on my facilities rainfall totals across the 
country. The removal of the map feature now makes this app not worth the 
space. Such a shame."
"278" "House Lights" 2 2017-06-14 "Worked good the first year this is the second year of using it and it is a hit and miss on rain falls now accurate any more. Had rain on my home farm watched it rain and it never even picked up a drop same on one of my other locations later last week completely missed the rain falls says we didn't get anything but it rained good. Have now deleted this app moving on to something better hopefully."

"284" "Jonathon Ehlers" 3 2018-10-06 "It is SOOO close! This is exactly what I was looking for, but it needs much more work. (Thus only 3 stars for now). The navigation home screen (with the blue buttons) and the hidden left tool bar feel redundant of each other. Consolidating many related tabs would serve you well. There are far too many buttons to sort through for the average farmer who has stuff to do. Labeling buttons with icons in addition to the text would also be more user friendly. It would also be great to record/upload GPS data on fields and for maintenance routine purposes, share maps with GIS points to employee accounts. Employee accounts that can receive invites to my specific farm would be a great addition so you could assign a specific task to an individual. People would seriously pay money for this! Again, overall its a GREAT start to this app! I will keep it around in case you do update and will update stars as earned. I really want this to succeed. I know little about app development, but if you want real farmer suggestions, I'd be happy to elaborate!"
"285" "Silverfire" 2 2020-05-27 "Works... sometimes. Can't see notes without entering edit screen, can't add notes without edit screen, even though it'll let you type all you want. Wipes info (such as birth date) upon entering edit screen. Glitches and is slow. Awesome idea, awful execution. Sad, because it is truly a one of a kind app, and much needed."
"286" "Collins Acholah" 4 2020-09-02 "Its an awesome app for record keeping. However, kindly include search handle in the fertilizer and sprays section to help sorting through the vast number of varities available. All in all i lpve it and have recomended it to a few more young farmers. Kudos"
"287" "Camfil Pty Ltd" 1 2020-08-21 "In farming we have goats, sheeps, chickens, turkeys, cows, horses, etc please make sure that all the species are catered for because during stock take in makes confusing when other animals are not accounted for. If possible, let option to save animal type as option by the farmer , that will solve all the problem."
"288" "Brian Zivanai Masunga" 3 2020-05-18 "It's fine but very slow, you also need to add a functionality which reminds me of pending vaccinations say ,10 days ahead of time. It also has to allow me to list all my annual vaccinations amd then remind me when it's approaching."
"289" "Pierre Viljoen" 1 2021-09-05 "Cant get my account fixed. Shows submission error. Need some assistance but cant get a hold of anyone. Like the app . Currently everything submitted undet crop is all the same date. Please help."

"422" "fer" 3 2016-07-11 "Some recent update has messed with the yield units. I can open up a crop, list the units will say \"cwt\" but when I email or save the crop, the units change to tons, but the nutrient numbers don't change. I'm sure there is a significant difference between 20 cwt and 20 tons for nutrient requirements. It makes reading actual requirements a bit difficult when you have to figure out what yield and units it's actually using."
"423" "Joey King" 3 2017-04-18 "App is okay, doesn't include most nut crops. Doesn't include the standard weight measurements for most California crops. Could easily import western fertilizer handbook statistics. I'm uninstalling because it doesn't apply to me."

The whole team has access to the data and its really improved our communication and teamwork skills as we all know what needs to be done. We always have a plan and we are always adapting to changes in weather and such and this tool is just Fantastic for keeping up to date with everything. EVEN THE COWS HAVE A ROTATION PLAN HAHA! Could not recommend anything other than this app! Defo worth it!"
"454" "Michael Deitering" 5 2022-02-18 "This app is perfect for a diversified farm. The free version is full of useful record keeping. The real life overhead view of the farm adds a level of tangibility which makes laying out tasks easy to manage. The facto that it can be shared among other people and provide chat is especially useful!"
"455" "Craig Willment" 4 2022-02-15 "I find the app very useful,especially the field mapping and as a record keeping platform for what has been done in each field and when it's done. Customer service and help has also been very good."

"459" "Jon Clatworthy" 4 2022-02-09 "Looks really useful. Anyway of integrating a field margin calculator that will create any width of width of field adjacent to boundaries or around features?

"464" "James Hill" 5 2021-10-18 "I'm managing 57 aquaculture ponds and even though this app isn't designed for aquaculture it's made keeping track of what is happening in each pond vastly easier. Very easy to use. They also have real people to chat with and answer questions regarding the app."
"465" "Mike Hoseason" 5 2022-02-14 "A great way of commuicating with our extended farming team. An awesome tool to record our development and progress. Much of our work involves the transitioning from traditional farming practices into regenerative agriculture and forests and Fieldmargin has been instrumental on this journey."
"466" "Sam Cassells" 3 2022-03-06 "Easy to use. Info and stats at your fingertips. Simply brilliant"
"467" "Charles Seamark" 5 2022-02-20 "Great app with more features being added all the time, and developers willing to listen."
"468" "Peter Machir-Grant" 5 2021-07-26 "If you've ever wanted a farm management app that works on all devices and covers every aspect of your farm, this is the app for you. It's intuitive, has lots of features, and just works. It works offline too. Allows you to stack those job lists up and take photos for reference later. Easy to get your staff on board and can even do print outs via your PC. 10/10 can't live without it now."
"469" "Paul Nehring" 5 2021-06-17 "Super easy to setup farm maps and use features. Subfields were just added and are needed feature, though using them is not quite as clear as other features. Developers responded to issues quickly. I hope the grazing features keep developing to get closer to other apps. Yet, this is one of the few that cover both farm operations and grazing, as well as livestock management."
"470" "Nathan Nelson" 4 2020-03-08 "Great app which has been happily picked up by our estate team including some more technophobic colleagues. Great interface. Friendly, responsive developers. Task planning is fun, overlaying uploaded maps is very useful. GPS functionality patchy (drawing areas by walking shows promise but doesn't work well) - this is more down to relying on phone GPS. Desktop satellite map images are out of date which is a frustration when planning work in the office. Really enjoyable, huge potential."
"471" "sandy McArthur" 4 2020-10-08 "Yeh look it's a good app, but I think it would help if you updated your satellite images every year or so. The other day I was trying to look for my boundary fence in a bunch of scrub and forest, which we made last year and couldn't find it. This was because of the images which were taken a few years earlier, so i could not mark the boundary. Other than that a great app"
"472" "Leon Muller" 5 2020-08-14 "Been using the middle tier verion of fieldmargin for four months now. Seems to work well on both samsung phone and ipad. Really practical functions but still simple to use and edit info and to view paddock history. I haven't used gps for mapping or yield maps so can't comment on that. Looking forward to the livestock side of things to be implemented- will make app better again if able to have cropping and livestock records in one place. Staff have been helpful and promp with and issues I've had."
"473" "Lance Thony" 5 2022-03-08 "Very good would recommend as a good tool beside gps easy to setup and use"
"474" "Lloyd Berry" 4 2022-02-12 "Love Field Margin , have used it for 3 years and has been great for planning jobs. length of new fence or water system , we did 12 km of pipe and fittings knowing where all the joins would be , simplified trough and isolation taps.Fantastic for field spray jobs. Put in a job name, pick paddocks, put in water rate, each chem and rate from inputs list save and the job buy list in reporting. As paddocks are done they are ticked off till job completed.

"476" "Stamate Sorin" 5 2021-11-29 "Hi. Does the app allow me to upload existing maps with geometries? Like shapefile or gpx? It would be very helpfull since i already have the files and i will not waste time to draw all fields again. Thanks!"
"477" "Richard Sands" 3 2021-10-14 "Would give it a run but not interested in having to create accounts etc. A stand alone package yes. Unfortunately couldn't even get started. Realise this isn't a fair appraisal but add this for others that are of same needs"
"478" "Cyfoh Nike" 3 2021-11-08 "I do enjoy this App, though I have problems with some of the functions like placing features like trees, and other stuff on the field..."
"479" "Laura Alvarez" 5 2021-10-31 "This app is helping us get a handle on a new ranch we purchased. I really like that we can add users and assign tasks."
"480" "WPR89" 4 2018-12-05 "I really like this app. Would give it 5 if the web version and mobile version used the same maps. If I create fields on the app (google maps) it does not fit precisely on the web version because web version uses bing. I would like to have the web version also use google maps so that created fields are not offset"
"481" "Ashley Corry" 5 2020-02-21 "Bloody brilliant for mapping out farms, hazards, water lines, creeks troughs and much more. Can be used for staff to complete and tick off jobs . To do lists and much more. Highly recommended from a long time farmer"
"482" "Francis Pik oloruntola" 5 2021-10-14 "This is a golden app for farmers in the recent time. I strongly recommend it to all categories of farmers."
"483" "Andrew Wise" 5 2020-01-21 "Brilliant app but the GPS location is often wrong and very slow at updating and keeping up when moving, very annoying when trying to map out new drains."
"484" "MrBouz GOLF" 4 2019-02-08 "What a excellent idea for user friendly software on my farm. Already using a bit and doing a trial with one of my managers to see how we can incorporate this software into the farm. Having our weekly meeting today and think well try and do most of our planning on it to see how it goes. I have a few extra ideas that I would like to add on it aswell."
"485" "Teeper Rhyma" 5 2020-09-27 "Very user friendly and perfectly powerful. Definitely recommend this app. I only use it to keep track of field locations and field names but it's capabilities are FAR beyond that. Great job Devs!<U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FC>"
"486" "Josiah Peter" 5 2020-05-10 "It is an in-depth app with lots of uses. The people at field margin are really helpful, i had a question and they replied quickly."
"487" "South Wales Detectorist" 5 2021-03-10 "Can I use this so to see farmers fields as I'm a metal detectorist, I have permission to detect on farms but not always 100% on all the land the farmer owns, I've downloaded the app but haven't registered yet until this question is answers, this app will be huge in the metal detecting world if we are able to just view who owns the land and what they have."
"488" "Bill Ashman" 1 2020-02-29 "Harrasment Nothing Short I uninstalled and unsubscribed from this app about 2 minutes after i installed it as it was rubbish. Despite an email from customer services assuring me that i would receive nothing further i had another email today. STOP IT."
"489" "Gavin Flowers" 5 2020-01-17 "An awesome app to use for both farms( total 110ha) that are used as pastures for hay making Recording comments notes are essential as we do 3 cuts a season so need to remind us often"

"577" "Sam Foote" 5 2022-03-07 "Excellent app for accurate measurements, very easy to pin exactly where you want to measure. I use the manual measuring tool a lot for measuring field boundaries and general yard measuring for building jobs etc. The GPS measuring tool isn't that great but I put that down to my phone's GPS quality rather than the app. Ads aren't too intrusive either."
"578" "Amir Hazrati" 5 2022-02-21 "It's so useful app for me as a farmer. I was using it in my old phone and it did a great job, but the thing is my new phone doesn't allow this app to use GPS when the screen is off. This is a problem for me because the farmland is big and takes a good time to have a circle around it. Also while jogging I can't put it in my pocket with the screen still turned on."
"579" "Muhammad Maaz Ullah Khan Sumbal" 5 2022-03-16 "A Very Good Experience. Excellent app to track your movement and measure the distances covered. I needed to measure the area of my agricultural land and it helped me alright."
"580" "Diwansingh Bhati" 5 2022-03-04 "if you looking for an app that calculate distance and meassurs area accurate then you have to try this app. it helps properly for field and area measurements. but the price for premium upgrade is high. app management have to reduce price. i hope they consider that point."
"581" "Steve Mccullough" 5 2022-03-22 "It allows you to measure a site, without having to physically go to a site, so I can give estimates to potential customers. Very convenient and time saving."
"582" "safdar mohammadi" 5 2022-02-05 "It's one of the best applications for measure the area, distance and find the point, it's very useful and easy to work,but I don't know that, can I send the saved file to another computer or application for print the map? thank you"
"583" "Ken Carlson" 3 2022-01-08 "This looks useful, but I have a few questions. 1. Is it possible to outline several areas on a single map, and print them all on the same map? Can the Pro version do this? 2. On Google Play, the Pro version is listed for $16.99, but in-app there is an option to upgrade to \"premium\" for $54.99 per year. Why the big discrepancy? What is the difference? 3. Is there an English website? There is a website link on Google Play, but it is not in English."
"584" "YOGENDRA VIKASH RAM" 5 2022-03-13 "This is the best ever app I have been using since 2018 to measure farms area and also used for navigation while fishing.Very simple and easy to use and works on any android device.No hesitation to rate 5 stars and recommended my friends to download and use and thumbs up frm them."
"585" "Brad West" 1 2022-03-21 "Do not waste your time or money you can get countless others for free that are exactly the same . no reason to be paying it's been a year now since I 1st downloaded this and I somehow accidentally paid the $55 for a full year subscription which I tried to cancel immediately and upon doing so really realized how much Of scam artist I was working with here they they refused to refund my money . It was not a half of a year later that is a lie and he knows it. I'll copy the emails and post here"
"586" "Jeremy Cullen" 3 2021-12-18 "This is a great app I use it everyday. I would give it a 5 if they would update the map. My farm has changed so much in the last 3 years with new races and hedges being ripped out but with no change to the map it makes it difficult"
"587" "Muhammad Asghar" 5 2022-03-14 "Very good app. It is best alternative of Costly GPS meter. But GPS meter is always best and accurate"
"588" "Jacques Van Der Merwe" 5 2021-12-20 "I love this app. You can stick to its simple settings or options or go into more skilled tweaking if the nodes, which ever suits you. It gives quick results."
"589" "Mzeewakazi" 5 2022-03-11 "excellent app, only thing I would kindly ask is not to get into politics as your icon shows, very sad for all who are suffering from both sides"
"590" "Charles Powell" 5 2022-03-14 "Very nice and easy to use. Love being able to.move pins and fine tune."
"591" "Jason Rich" 4 2022-03-27 "Seems to be a really good app, really accurate and easy to use. Kudos devs!!"
"592" "Emma Lambie" 5 2022-03-15 "Great app, awesome to work out lengths and area, accurate to about 1m on lengths"
"593" "Andreas Hatz" 1 2019-07-14 "Downloaded this app to measure areas in a field. Got nothing out of it. All it did was show my position on the map, without recording any distances, areas or position points. No clear way of achieving either of these objectives. Not very intuitive user interface. So got nothing out of it except a few ads. Waste of my time. Definitely not going to take a chance with a paid version in case it is just as useless."
"594" "Edgar Quintana" 5 2021-05-29 "Very accurate, easy to use, paid version eliminates ads and ads bonus features. I've accuracy check by measuring area with measuring wheel, the results are phenomenal spite three meter difference. I don't want to sound like a cookie cutter comment but highly recommended. I've already mentioned accuracy at the beginning. In my opinion it deserves two mentions. Very happy with app, I use it for material applied and billing on my line of work. It saves me time. Thank you !"
"595" "Institutional Division" 5 2020-01-10 "This app is better. It could be the best if you could add feature like AUTO MEASURE the distance or the length of the road from one place to another by just pinning the starting point and end point. You know it is very tiresome and annoying to measure point by point the very long and much winding road. And along with the road-length measurement, also add the straight-line measurement---not by the road. Thanks."
"596" "Michael Bryant" 4 2019-04-22 "instructions would be helpful. but not real hard to trial and error learn. would like to have more than 1 group of properties to group looks like that is available in the premium package but what is free gives me the field acreage which is what I need. updated mapping would be helpful. mapping is at least 5 years old. I know because I have a building that is not shown."
"597" "Graham Penner" 3 2020-03-11 "This app has been handy for establishing my farm's property markers, field edges and of course determining the size of my fields. Would love to be able to use Ontario GIS satellite imaging with it as it has the best image quality for my property. Unfortunately, it is really easy to stop tracking during a mapping session with the start/stop button at the very edge of the screen."
"598" "Martin Malcomson" 5 2018-11-08 "Pretty accurate measurements and features for a free app. I use it for outdoor activities all the time now. Great for airsoft, our just showing friends where tails are and how long of a walk. Great app. I was asked to rate when I first opened the app, before I could even see the screen layout, I gave 2 stars after a few days of use easy 5 Stars and probably be upgrading to pro version. Excellent job developers!"
"599" "dontnubblemebro" 5 2018-12-11 "I've been using this app for quite a long time, for sowing and spray rate applications, plus fencing quotes and such. While I've never used the more advanced features, the basic distance and area measurement is fantastic. Most of the people I've done work for and their neighbours are using it, I've received quite a few cases of beer for it!"
"600" "Ramu Sangem" 4 2021-08-03 "Very useful app. Distance measurement is accurate (deviation of about 2-3 ft). GPS measurement fluctuates but we can measure using \"add point\" without using \"start measuring\" . Only issue I have faced is that when we calculate a closed area, we are shown only the total perimeter and area but the lengths of the sides are not shown. Would appreciate if someone can help me if this app supports this side length feature too."
"601" "Eth Ratha" 4 2022-03-26 "Good feature and easy to use."
"602" "Kris Andrues" 2 2019-12-26 "I paid extra for an upgraded version, so I could save my walks. However, in order to save measurements I would have to buy a monthly subscription - I THOUGHT I was getting a version that would do just that when I paid the extra amount. It also has to stay on - I could not switch to a different screen like to listen to music when I'm walking. This app is not useful to me"
"603" "Jim Long" 4 2019-10-22 "I am an electrical engineer with some programming experience. This app is a great use off cell phone features, specifically the GPS. I am using it to calculate area of our small pastures to estimate the amount of winter rye seed needed. On our first pasture the mapping showed a couple of spurs in the outline that I did not walk. This could be the app or possibly my cell phone GPS system. Other than that it is quite handy."
"604" "Oscar Maroo" 5 2022-03-17 "The best app ever on area measurements estimations, it has really come in handy."
"605" "Thomas calil" 5 2022-01-12 "So far it's working very well. I'd like to purchase full version (not subscription) and add an external GPS antenna. Which model works?"
"606" "Robert Biascan" 5 2022-03-01 "Amazing ,wonderful and what an idea to creat this kind of apps."
"607" "george spiciarich" 1 2020-11-14 "Terrible. Dont waste your time. I tested against measured distances. It wasn't even close. The app had difficulty in accurately locating the start point under clear sky conditions (ie no overhead trees, clear sky day) I walked a 90 ft measured line multiple times with the app. Results were from 68 to 126 ft. Couldnt reproduce the same measurement even once. The app occasionally cant accurately locate at the beginning of the measure. Off by miles in some cases. Google maps would find me"
"608" "Rick McKeegan" 4 2018-12-08 "Just to try this app...I was paving asphalt at an airport so took shots along the perimeter of my work. Our survey provides me with total square footage of my area for payment. When I compared my shots using GPS with survey's, we were only about 500 square feet different from 38,800 sq ft placement. Fantastic! Now...my shots were taken on a clear day so signal response was at it's highest. Love this app!"
"609" "Muhammad Khalid Siddique" 2 2021-11-18 "It has no option to save measurements...it's major issue...<U+0001F44E> There is no way to save from uninstalling.... Can I save my data in this application if it is has been deleted from cell phone.???"
"610" "Rameez Raja" 4 2021-11-12 "Not accurate. Accuracy 93%.. Otherwise very good and also some important unit in area measurement missing like square feet etc"
"611" "Fowad Ahmed Khan." 1 2022-01-22 "When i imported kml of size 2 mb containing measurements .. app can't handle and crashes whenever i start app . What is this .. even I've brought premium. It sucks"

"613" "Rajy Raja" 5 2022-02-16 "Very useful for measuring distance and area"
"614" "Just a dude passing by" 1 2022-03-05 "Downloaded one new phone, still doesn't work? I can send you a screen shot. STILL SUCKS, I put in an address in Texas and it takes me to Russia or newfoundland....??? Have reinstalled and un-installed so many times...doesn't ever work!! Sucks now, doesnt locate on first-third try, than error codes pop up. Terrible, used to love this app. Need phone running android 9.0"
"615" "Subodh K" 4 2021-11-25 "This application needs to be accurate and better, improve and improve, The quality of pictures and graphics needs to be improved."
"616" "Florida 4Runner" 1 2019-11-13 "Location by address not working anymore, I had this app for a full year using it almost daily,I could just type in a address and it would jump to the correct location ,now after renewing my subscription It can't find a single address and jumps to irrelevant out of state locations, after months of requesting help from IT department no response has been received,it was great but now it's worthless for what you pay for unless they can fix this issue it's not worth the money,one star for no response"
"617" "sevenfoot monkey" 5 2022-02-21 "Simple, basic, useful, works."
"618" "Rodney Flanegan" 1 2022-02-28 "I have used this app for year's and it worked perfectly. However ilost my phone and had to download it again. It measures areas/,distance well. But it won't save anything."
"619" "Santoso Wardoyo Ramelan" 5 2022-03-09 "easy to use. very helpful."
"620" "Zwanga Mbedzi" 5 2022-03-08 "Makes life on site simple and effective for big area measurements."
"621" "ayushya prakash" 5 2021-12-27 "If you are looking for an app which can calculate an area on map or tell you the distance on the map then this is the application you are looking for. Good app with nill advertisements."
"622" "Main Chow" 4 2022-03-15 "One of the best measuring applications I have ever used. Ease of use and accuracy are remarkable. If it add further magnification option it would be fantastic."
"623" "Jeremy McCullough" 4 2020-02-09 "I've been using this app for a couple years and love it. About as accurate as you can expect from an app. The only thing i would recommend is make a feature that allows you to measure a square or cirle then add a house, barn or grain bin to those measured dimensions. You could in scale add additions to your properties to have an easy visual of how it would lay out before you begin building."
"624" "Jared Russouw" 3 2018-11-18 "I really like the idea and the look of the app. Dissapointing that basic functions such as differant colors for the markers and areas are only available to premium users. I would upgrade to premium, but the cost of R42 just doesn't warrant it."
"625" "Erickson Targa" 5 2022-03-12 "Absolutely free and amazing app."
"626" "oussama yami" 4 2022-03-11 "Very good app, so usefull for professional"
"627" "suresh Baswaraj" 5 2022-03-27 "If you app super explain the situation and great Idea for approval and app"
"628" "Mahiraj Rathore" 5 2022-03-27 "Very easy to use n useful app"
"629" "Tupeni Gonelevu" 5 2022-03-21 "It's helpful and accurate"
"630" "Justin harry" 5 2022-03-11 "Very handy and easy yo use..."
"631" "Dirk Rodenburg" 5 2022-03-15 "So easy to use! Great app"
"632" "David Lintz" 5 2020-02-24 "I was asked to rate this app shortly after I downloaded it. I gave it one star because there were no instructions with it and I couldn't get it to work. After playing with it for awhile I figured out how to use it and now I love it. I'm impressed with the results. It's a great tool to easily get an estimate of dimensions and areas, but you still need to do physical measurements if accuracy is required."
"633" "Thomas Kemp" 1 2020-12-31 "This app was about 40 times off of an area measurement. It's lacking some key features like showing boundaries, the GPS was showing I was 4 miles from my official location (Google maps showed my location just fine) and while the perimeter measure seemed accurate, the acreage measurement was saying 80 acres instead of 2 acres. Also, if you like ads of green alien women with big bosoms, you might be interested in this app because it was NOTHING BUT ADS EVERY TIME YOU TRIED TO DO ANYTHING."
"634" "PASANG" 5 2021-02-15 "I have been using this app since 2018 and it's very easy to use. When there is good internet coverage, the results are 99% accurate when compared with cadastral survey. I would like to suggest the developers to add features for taking photos like the SW map and also feature for traking to predetermined points."
"635" "Annie C" 5 2019-07-02 "I found this app easy to use. I calibrated it on a site map and found it very accurate. I picked a lot of points to map out the boundary of my fields alternating between satellite and road map outlines. Thanks for this. It served my purpose well."
"636" "CE Brown" 5 2019-04-05 "This application really cleared up my lot line issue. I had to experiment on the first try, but once i got the hang of it, I was good to go! ........and just to let folks know NJ rural lot lines are hard to follow especially when the lots are odd shapes. Nothing is cut and dry in South Jersey."
"637" "b s" 5 2020-03-30 "Great app. Used to to roughly map out the 1.5 acres in the woods where we plan on building. Very easy to use. Just press start measuring and walk. Thats it. It tells you the length, acreage and draws a line on the satellite map with the terrain."
"638" "Jeff Mauldin" 1 2019-04-19 "I simply wanted an app to find survey pins, this was totally useless for that, of course it has no real instructions or directions so for all I know this app wasn't for surveying. hell, for all I could get out of it it may be a cooking app, but today useless to find survey pins. I did however get a good look at my property, sadly it us 4 years old because the change a from that time aren't on your map. update: I downloaded another app and their's worked fine, so be glad there is no zero rating."
"639" "phani kumar" 4 2019-03-05 "in this app not available multiple enters coordinates (latitude, longitude), only one time recording coordinates. for accurate area drawing on map. I want to calculate area to our agriculture land. if I take multiple positions using latitude and longitude accurately. then I enters this Location points in application and add these points then I wanted to prepare the documents."
"640" "Phil Revis" 5 2020-06-22 "Tutorial needs to be much more in depth. Using it as I went. You would think it would be a simple start here drop pin, got to point B, drop pin, go to point C, etc. Then measure, all I got was a grey dot at point A, then some funky longitude and latitude at B, and nothing at C, or D, then it gave me some straight line measurement. UPDATE TO LAST REVIEW: THEIR IMPROVEMENTS AND MY TAKING A LITTLE MORE TIME TO WORK WITH THE APP MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE! WOULD NOW HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!"
"641" "Clayton Wolfenden-Fisher" 4 2020-03-19 "Love the experience on Android. Mapping manually can be very glitchy on iOS. Subscriptions are far too pricey for me, but the free version does a lot. If there was a buy for medium around $60 AU per annum. I'd be in."
"642" "Thomas Rodrigue" 5 2019-05-29 "Just have the free version. Layed out my property lines on the satellite view using the distance function with my official recorded survey numbers. Wow. I'd like to talk to the surveyors back then. My lot is not square. The front is 95.45ft across and the back is 86.25 across. 90' front and 90' rear would have been more logical. Now it looks like I'm mowing 5 feet into my neighbors yard. We are friends. Had a good laugh. Good app. Thks."
"643" "Kwashirai Karima" 2 2019-07-20 "It was the perfect app for me until I woke up and found that all the points, areas and distances i had spent months measuring and saving are gone! Not sure what went wrong or if that data can be retrieved??"
"644" "Colin Elrick" 5 2021-03-28 "Saved me thousands. So, so handy during sowing and harvest operations. You can figure out hectares in a few clicks and know where you are and what you need. Wonderful app. Sometimes modern technology does reduce stress and workload! :-)"
"645" "Gabriel Marinho" 4 2021-06-30 "Really good, helped a lot to plan my co struction on the land. not sure how to get elevation of points. I would like to export a vector to other programs, and make level curves. I would pay for these functionalities."
"646" "Chimera Comstock" 1 2020-04-27 "App keeps crashing when opening. This is my third time to have to reinstall the app this week to be able to use it and I lose all my saved measurements when that happens. Worked great for 6months but now won't open and of it does it crashes right away. I'm using it on a Note 10."
"647" "Tamara Follett" 5 2019-04-24 "Wow! I have downloaded a dozen of these apps over the years and this one is by far the best! Very powerful, intuitive, minimal ads! I used it to obtain area and measurements for a planned dog yard. Highly Recommended."
"648" "John Zikas" 5 2018-10-13 "Very useful if you need to get a very accurate measurement of an area in the go! I'm in real estate business and this has really helped and I've tested the measurements with real values of some plots of land, the app is less than 3% off!"
"649" "Ryan Thomas" 3 2021-09-10 "It is a well thought out app and im certain it could have its uses. But it is not accurate. I measured a 2km course to practice for army fitness and wondered why i was so slow. Turns out iv been doing closer to 3km! Thats quite a wide margin of error"
"650" "S Mitchell" 1 2020-01-21 "Customer service could improve. I have tried to get a response for the last 4 months with no reply. Liked the program very very much that there is a glitch I'm having trouble with so I guess I will have to stop my subscription and find another app."
"651" "Jason Judihardjo" 1 2020-09-24 "Worthless app. Inaccurate, confusing displays. Dowload counts can be a deceiving factor. If app has nothing to do with accuracy deal with area viewer instead of area measure. Accuracy is important for measure. I am a user and the excuses you gave me is none of my concern, I am just reviewing and sharing my experience."
"652" "RAHUL S" 5 2019-12-22 "I am using this app since 2017 and there is no problem at all. Till now i measure lots of plots. I would like suggest that, after taking area measuremen please mention there name for points which we have taken like point A, Point B, Point C likewise and the should be a given distance between two such points, and if possible to creat a page where all this info diaplay. Thanks a lot for ur great app..."
"653" "TWH Ranch" 2 2021-03-14 "Not very accurate, may be OK if your looking for a very rough estimate. Tryed the app on a known level plot of land with corners already marked and official per country records. The result of sum area was off by almost an acre. Google Earth is a lot more accurate, but decided this app a try with high hopes all for not."
"654" "stevie wonder" 5 2021-04-04 "Great. Would be nice if when doing area the distance also shows up at the same time. I found I had to save one distance each time than use the area to figure it out cause I'm bad at this stuff. Great app. 4.8 stars so I round it to 5!!"
"655" "James Dorey" 1 2019-06-18 "I like the idea, but measurements are at best questionable. I reckon they're out by a factor of at least ten based on my preliminary estimates (which are based on Newton's Method). On the other hand, I have my doubts about GPS accuracy here in Tasmania generally. A timely response from the developers to this criticism suggests choosing \"high accuracy\" setting on my device. I shouldn't need to spell out that if I am measuring something, I would have done so (and did) in the first place."
"656" "Joni Vasbinder" 5 2021-07-10 "Best app. We use this a lot for digging out square feet in whatever fields we want to plant our spray. Measuring distance to put new fences in. So much easier than walking out or even riding it with a measuring device in theTexas heat. Measurements have been accurate."
"657" "Ninni Bontich" 5 2020-06-18 "Great app, does what it is ment to do. Makes feeding cows very easy, I wouldn't be without the crop counculator for working out fodder beet during transition. I use it daily. Only upgrade would be to be able to add supplement to total kg/dm. But that can be calculated in a separate working anyway. I would recommend this app."
"658" "kiwiflyer new Zealand" 5 2020-06-10 "Awsome app the glitch has been fixed"

It would be great to add a sample number and have the app sequentially number further as one takes the soil samples in the field. The function to import or export soil sampling points seems not the available - it poses the question whether it is useful to have this great app but the the result of the app's functions stays with the app."

"818" "A Google user" 1 2019-03-25 "I just downloaded this app on my phone because I have used it before and was able to utilize it for mixing chemicals on the farm.

"819" "Steven DiBella" 5 2019-01-24 "It's fixed! The \"accept terms\" button did not work for a long time but after a bunch of reviews the seem to have fixed it. Awesome app, makes mixing tanks very simple"

"839" "Kenneth Hanna" 1 2018-05-05 "Looks like a great app but it won't work on my phone. I have a Motorola 
Moto and after I load it it asked me to read the agreement and accept. And 
when I hit the accept button it does nothing. I can't get past that point. 
I uninstalled and reinstalled sure will times and still the same problem. 
Let me know when you have this problem fixed because I would love to try 
your app."
"840" "Ethan Leadbeater" 3 2018-05-22 "Great concept. The calculator feature is handy. I cannot get any labels to

"841" "Todd Weis" 1 2017-12-06 "After install; initial opening of the app requires you to accept Terms of Use. However the \"Accept\" button is not working , therefore you cannot use the app.  Maybe apps needs an update since it was written in 2015 and I'm using it on Android 8.0.0?  Hopefully this gets fixed soon so I can provide better review."

"875" "Kevin Kundel" 5 2013-07-03 "Great app I love that the new version lets me edit the rates of chemicals in the same mix without starting over. The ability to send the mix is also great. I can send it to the person mixing for me from the sprayer. Great app. THANKS!"
"876" "A Google user" 2 2012-07-19 "With a few tweaks, this could be a go-to app, but is not very useful to me as it is.  The pre-populated lists of chemicals are really nice, but the work flow doesn't lend itself to the way I load a sprayer.  If a Taplogic developer reads this, please consider the following enhancements:  1.  Allow saving a recipe (all ingredients plus rate per acre and max tank size) independent of acres to be sprayed. 2.  On the \"Total Materials\" report screen, also list the total volume of the solution in gallons."
"877" "A Google user" 3 2012-05-26 "Nice for farming but... Not very applicable for commercial applicators. Would be GREAT to have the option of sq./ft. not just by the acre. Also, chemicals from Wilbur-Ellis for commercial/residential turf applications would make a nice addition."
"878" "A Google user" 4 2012-02-27 "Tank mixes Need to be able to save a tank mix then be able to apply it to a different amount of acres.  Not just saved in history to one certain amount of acreage. Other than that good app."
"879" "A Google user" 3 2012-02-23 "Farmmer1 Needs ability top calculate in metric chemical doseage (ie) liters/acre"
"880" "Mike Trueman" 2 2013-02-25 "Limited No products for small grains farmers or R&P customers. Very Very limited!!!!!!! No Dow, Dupont, BASF, Bayer, its mainly a generic glyphosate and that's it app"
"881" "Chris Stockman" 4 2013-03-13 "Chemicals Its almost planting time. Are you going to put all the chemicals onto the list. It is short chemicals."
"882" "A Google user" 4 2012-03-10 "Nice Would be nice if it had the option of 28% instead of water and nitrogen stabilizers like instinct."
"883" "Josh" 4 2013-01-10 "Lack of chemicals Needs more chemicals such as viper"
"884" "Bob" 2 2013-06-21 "Can you make this in metric? All the chemicals are in metric."

"887" "A Google user" 5 2012-05-19 "Perfect Does just what I wanted."
"888" "A Google user" 4 2011-09-11 "Nice start You need to add the ability to save tank mixes after they are created for use later. No sense having to create them again when you want to use them a second time. You also need the ability to quickly calculate a \"partial fill\" when you need to fill less than a full load."
"889" "A Google user" 5 2011-08-27 "Nice app Simple and works well. I really like the integrated chemical list."
"890" "A Google user" 1 2011-12-31 "Very poor calculations Doesn't subtract the products added from total carrier needed."
"891" "A Google user" 5 2011-12-09 "Eric Very nice and handy. My one and only suggestion is to be able to delete the history if need be."
"892" "A Google user" 1 2018-08-13 "This app does not work with the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus. Very disappointed 
that it doesn't. It will not let me accept the terms to allow me to use the

users."
"893" "Kevin Shields" 5 2018-05-14 "It was a wonderful app. Used it for years. Got a new phone and reinstalled

to find a different one."
